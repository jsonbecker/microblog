One involved very close dieting, done at a time when my life was more routine and far less stressful. The other involved an expensive gym that was entirely scheduled, small group training, coupled with dieting that was not quite as extreme.</p>\n\n<p>About six months before the pandemic, I stopped going to the gym with small group training. I had been there a few years. I felt I learned how to work out successfully, how to keep a routine, and what to do. I thought maybe I could save a little money and try and do this on my own.

				"content_text": "I've had two successful runs at getting healthier and losing weight in my adult life. One involved very close dieting, done at a time when my life was more routine and far less stressful. The other involved an expensive gym that was entirely scheduled, small group training, coupled with dieting that was not quite as extreme.\n\nAbout six months before the pandemic, I stopped going to the gym with small group training. I had been there a few years. I felt I learned how to work out successfully, how to keep a routine, and what to do. I thought maybe I could save a little money and try and do this on my own.

What he thought was wrong, and he should have figured out that he was wrong sooner, and today he knows that.</p>\n\n<p>Forgiveness requires contrition. And I do believe that Leno is contrite, but that&rsquo;s not for me to decide. We&rsquo;re doomed if we cannot find a way to forgive anyone for any transgression in society, but we (largely white men) also need to do a better job. We need to learn faster and better, by listening more often and more closely. Part of that is learning how to apologize.</p>\n\n<p>Leno said things in the past that he thought were funny. He thought they did not create harm, directly or indirectly. He failed to listen to peoples&rsquo; pain, and he failed to consider their pain or impact adequately before making these statements to begin with.

				"content_text": "{{< tweet 1374784434096926720 >}}\n\nWhat Leno gets wrong is exactly the headline, \"In my heart, I knew it was wrong.”\n\nThis quote is more honest:\n\n> “At the time I did those jokes, I genuinely thought them to be harmless.”\n\nThat's real. What he thought was wrong, and he should have figured out that he was wrong sooner, and today he knows that.\n\nForgiveness requires contrition. And I do believe that Leno is contrite, but that's not for me to decide. We're doomed if we cannot find a way to forgive anyone for any transgression in society, but we (largely white men) also need to do a better job. We need to learn faster and better, by listening more often and more closely. Part of that is learning how to apologize.\n\nLeno said things in the past that he thought were funny. He thought they did not create harm, directly or indirectly. He failed to listen to peoples' pain, and he failed to consider their pain or impact adequately before making these statements to begin with. We all do this at times, especially when we're young, though hopefully not so much by the time we're adult professionals.\n\nOwn it. Be wrong. There was no “In my heart, I knew it was wrong.” You didn't feel anything in your heart at all about it. If you did, it would mean that your empathy was triggered and there's no way you would have made those jokes, or stood behind them when called out.\n\nI have said terrible things I wish I could forget. But worse, I have said terrible things I have forgotten because in my heart, _they meant nothing to me_. I feel sadly certain that I will do so again.\n\nI am sorry. I hope I learn better, faster. But when my heart knows anything at all, it prevents me from making those mistakes. That's its job.\n",

The message players sent was not that point guards are now moonlighting as legislators, but literally, their humanity must come first -- that these Black lives literally matter.\n\n\nKaepernick was right then, he's right now, and the conservative, white backlash will be judged poorly by history. It's thrilling to see athletes use their power.\n\n[They Know How to Prevent Megafires. Why Won’t Anybody Listen?](https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen):\n\n> Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California.

That meant such a candidate needed a 4.0 GPA to get the same rating as a white male with a 3.75.</p></blockquote>\n\nPowerful evidence of continued bias in the form of the wide gap between stated and revealed preferences.\n\n[Filmmakers’ look inside US immigration crackdown draws legal threats](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/25/immigration-documentary-trump-threats-block/112387528/)\n\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/25/immigration-documentary-trump-threats-block/112387528/\"><p>Some of the contentious scenes include ICE officers lying to immigrants to gain access to their homes and mocking them after taking them into custody. One shows an officer illegally picking the lock to an apartment building during a raid.</p>\n\n<p>At town hall meetings captured on camera, agency spokesmen reassured the public that the organization’s focus was on arresting and deporting immigrants who had committed serious crimes. But the filmmakers observed numerous occasions in which officers expressed satisfaction after being told by supervisors to arrest as many people as possible, even those without criminal records.</p>\n\n<p>“Start taking collaterals, man,” a supervisor in New York said over a speakerphone to an officer who was making street arrests as the filmmakers listened in. “I don’t care what you do, but bring at least two people,” he said.</p></blockquote>\n\nThe cruelty is the point.\n\n[\"I Was a Starter Wife\": Inside America's Messiest Divorce](https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a5380/millionaire-starter-wife/)\n\nElon Musk is a huge piece of shit.

Part of me wants to believe that box office transparency became self-reinforcing-- things became popular because they were popular, which could be bought to some degree, and therefore, smaller, high quality movies weren't getting made. Popular movies were memetic and spreading somehow through their economics and not their quality. Another part of me thinks that the \"surprise\" hits that perform much better than expected and then reap massive rewards are an important part of finding and rewarding the folks that make quality culture.\n\nMostly I think that gifs will always reveal how popular something actually is and ensure it spreads.

				"content_html": "<p>I was fortunate enough to spend time with my parents this July 4th weekend when this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spencercompton/status/1279579382793875459?s=21\">video</a> of protestors in Baltimore pulling down Christopher Columbus’s statue went viral. First, because it happened to be Spencer’s video, a good friend from high school <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:bmore\"><a href=\"#fn:bmore\">1</a></sup>, and so it caught their attention, and second because they asked me why people were tearing down Columbus’s statue. What’s wrong with Columbus?</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, my parents both have voted for democrats my entire life. Their politics have consistently been center-left. My fiancé is half Haitian. They should know about Columbus and how he treated the Taino on Hispaniola. They should, but they don’t. Because although I had classroom conversations about <em>Christopher Columbus: Hero or Villain</em>, they did not. When they were in school in the 60s and 70s, Columbus was a fully fictionalized, canonized, rehabilitated hero of American folklore.

				"content_text": "I was fortunate enough to spend time with my parents this July 4th weekend when this [video](https://twitter.com/spencercompton/status/1279579382793875459?s=21) of protestors in Baltimore pulling down Christopher Columbus’s statue went viral. First, because it happened to be Spencer’s video, a good friend from high school [^bmore], and so it caught their attention, and second because they asked me why people were tearing down Columbus’s statue. What’s wrong with Columbus?\n\n[^bmore]: Funny how we’re both in Baltimore after growing up in New York.\n\nThe thing is, my parents both have voted for democrats my entire life. Their politics have consistently been center-left. My fiancé is half Haitian. They should know about Columbus and how he treated the Taino on Hispaniola. They should, but they don’t. Because although I had classroom conversations about _Christopher Columbus: Hero or Villain_, they did not. When they were in school in the 60s and 70s, Columbus was a fully fictionalized, canonized, rehabilitated hero of American folklore. While controversy over Columbus’s legacy has shown up in campus newspapers, short local news stories, and opinions pieces each year in October, it’s easy to miss, forget, and ignore.\n\nWhen we keep monuments to historical figures in every major city, the controversy is drowned out by the ubiquity.

The only \"expediters\" necessary should be city employees doing their jobs in the normal course of business. Anything less is a failure.\n\nCrises are great clarifiers. Each one creates massive problems that need solving. Sometimes those problems are brand new and will require new thinking. But often crises serve to push hard on existing fault lines and pressure points that reformers and activists have pointed at for years as systemic failures. Many of our great cities have failed at being great places to do business and have failed to keep vacancies down as rent went up.\n\nWe don't have to keep failing.\n",

My right now, now also presenting with keratoconus could not receive corneal cross-linking, a promising laser-based treatment to temper the progression of keratoconus, because my left eye vision was so poor the risks outweighed the benefits.</p>\n\n<p>The hope?

For the first time, I had a meaningful professional network. I left my first job for all the right reasons. I had learned a lot but could see no opportunities for growth or change on the horizon. My boss would hold his job for at least another 7 and maybe 10 years. I wasn’t sure I’d want his job anyway. I was trusted and respected, and already had opportunities to work in almost all parts of the organization and choose the projects I wanted to contribute to. I had a great job, but it would be that same job forever. Meanwhile, three years out from finishing my undergraduate degree and a couple of years out from graduate school, I saw many of my classmates switching jobs into new and exciting opportunities that they came across through the professional networks they were building. I was building no network— we had no money for professional development, a complete travel ban unless required as a part of a grant, and I worked in a state agency in a small state. It a was hard decision— I did enjoy my job, but I needed to leave to grow.</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e0a0362dce.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:PPAC Square ;description:Downcity Providence is beautiful in the snow.\"\n   \n>\n<img  \n        src = \"https://micro.blog/photos/260x/https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e0a0362dce.jpg\"\n     \n     \n     \n        title=PPAC&#32;Square&#32; \n     \n     style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e24135e38e.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Gracie at my Parents ;description:She finds the top of a couch with a window anywhere that we go.\"\n   \n>\n<img  \n        src = \"https://micro.blog/photos/260x/https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e24135e38e.jpg\"\n     \n     \n     \n        title=Gracie&#32;at&#32;my&#32;Parents&#32; \n     \n     style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f63524ca5e.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Cross-armed Gracie ;description:A classic pose she still does on this same couch.\"\n   \n>\n<img  \n        src = \"https://micro.blog/photos/260x/https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f63524ca5e.jpg\"\n     \n     \n     \n        title=Cross-armed&#32;Gracie&#32; \n     \n     style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/137dbf8a52.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Kayaking ;description:Evidence that at least once, Elsa and I actually went a did something outdoorsy, which we always say we&#39;re going to do.

I left a supportive, if limited, environment and found myself unready for the rigors of independence. I had two bosses in two different organizations, both of whom saw me as self-motivated and self-reliant, My work was largely long term projects. I went from working in a cubicle on many small projects always on a team to working alone in a quiet office or from home if I chose to do so. While I had a professional community through my fellowship, in many ways, my daily professional life was quiet and lonely. I made steady progress but had a hard time building day to day motivation. I had long thought I might get a Ph.D., but it became horrifyingly clear that managing an independent, long term research project was draining, not invigorating. I enjoyed teaching and being a part of an academic community, but I knew the long odds of getting a tenure track position. Now joining academia not only seemed unobtainable but also undesirable. What was I going to do?</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/39e50da5a0.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2013\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Bed and Breakfast Murder Mystery;description:We dressed up for a winter weekend bed and breakfast murder mystery experience.

We had just completed redoing our kitchen and bathroom and everything at our condo was just how we liked it. Although Elsa decided to leave her job and was looking for work, the last two years we had started to feel established in our community in Providence. We had solid personal and professional supports.

I turned 30, and I started to take working out more seriously because years of work travel and neglect made me feel bad. I wanted to get back some of the healthy habits I had built a few years prior when Elsa and I both lost a fair amount of weight. Allovue&rsquo;s CTO Ted left, and I was put in charge of development in addition to design, product management, and data integration. Although we weathered that initial transition well, I think it&rsquo;s only in 2019 that I truly began to feel comfortable with my new role. We also released our first version of our Budget tool, our second major software product. We bought our house in Hampden, Baltimore. For the first time, we have enough room for family and friends to visit and stay with us and we can host holidays. I love our new home and we&rsquo;re building a nice life here. Some of my heart remains in Providence, but Baltimore is nudging its way in. I still don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;ve built the strong emotional ties to Baltimore I had for Providence, but I&rsquo;d like to get there someday.</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/85ec08e231.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2017\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Chilaquiles;description:The best chilaquiles I&#39;ve ever eaten.

He was always generous to my ideas and experience managing software and technical integration projects in a dramatically different environment and helped me to understand how software was built differently in product companies and software consultancies. He always respected and elevated my technical skills, both within our private conversations and with colleagues. I still struggle with feelings of inadequacies in this area, but Ted never hesitated to lift me back up and remind me we all struggle with imposter syndrome. He never made me feel not up to the task, but instead like I had someone to work with to get better. I think it was his idea that I should be made Chief Product Officer, or at least I know that he was strongly consulted about my growing role at Allovue. And when he left Allovue in 2017, he was clear that he felt comfortable doing so in part because of his faith in my ability to take on the leadership of the team he worked hard to build.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:ted\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

For the first time, I had a meaningful professional network. I left my first job for all the right reasons. I had learned a lot but could see no opportunities for growth or change on the horizon. My boss would hold his job for at least another 7 and maybe 10 years. I wasn’t sure I’d want his job anyway. I was trusted and respected, and already had opportunities to work in almost all parts of the organization and choose the projects I wanted to contribute to. I had a great job, but it would be that same job forever. Meanwhile, three years out from finishing my undergraduate degree and a couple of years out from graduate school, I saw many of my classmates switching jobs into new and exciting opportunities that they came across through the professional networks they were building. I was building no network— we had no money for professional development, a complete travel ban unless required as a part of a grant, and I worked in a state agency in a small state. It a was hard decision— I did enjoy my job, but I needed to leave to grow.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e0a0362dce.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"PPAC Square \" description=\"Downcity Providence is beautiful in the snow.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e24135e38e.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"Gracie at my Parents \" description=\"She finds the top of a couch with a window anywhere that we go.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f63524ca5e.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"Cross-armed Gracie \" description=\"A classic pose she still does on this same couch.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/137dbf8a52.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"Kayaking \" description=\"Evidence that at least once, Elsa and I actually went a did something outdoorsy, which we always say we're going to do.

I left a supportive, if limited, environment and found myself unready for the rigors of independence. I had two bosses in two different organizations, both of whom saw me as self-motivated and self-reliant, My work was largely long term projects. I went from working in a cubicle on many small projects always on a team to working alone in a quiet office or from home if I chose to do so. While I had a professional community through my fellowship, in many ways, my daily professional life was quiet and lonely. I made steady progress but had a hard time building day to day motivation. I had long thought I might get a Ph.D., but it became horrifyingly clear that managing an independent, long term research project was draining, not invigorating. I enjoyed teaching and being a part of an academic community, but I knew the long odds of getting a tenure track position. Now joining academia not only seemed unobtainable but also undesirable. What was I going to do?\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/39e50da5a0.jpg\" gallery=\"2013\" title=\"Bed and Breakfast Murder Mystery\" description=\"We dressed up for a winter weekend bed and breakfast murder mystery experience.

I still can’t quite believe the series of events that conspired to put us in a room together that day, for me to ask a conference panel a question, for her to hand me her card, and for me to know just enough to realize that a once in a lifetime opportunity fell in my lap. I met my future boss, mentor, and a dear friend through a chance encounter 2000 miles from home. During my interview, Jess told me she saw “C-level potential” in me. I didn’t understand what she meant, or what she saw in me that I did not see in myself. I guess she was right, a pattern that continues until today, because...\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/90d56f9131.jpg\" gallery=\"2014\" title=\"Jess Gartner's Move\" description=\"Jess sent me this photo when we were discussing me coming to work at Allovue.

I formally left behind a role defined by data analysis to one defined by product management. I am not sure I knew what product management meant. I’m still figuring that out. [^ted] That summer, we released our first product, Manage. The night before a major product demo and our \"announcing\" we were in the market with our first customer, everything was broken. I was shaking I was so nervous. At every moment, it felt like I was about to be more proud of what we had accomplished than of any other thing I have done in my whole career or like we were about to fail in some irrecoverable way and this ride would be over. We got it fixed, it worked, we made our first critical sales, and Jess was able to raise our Series A round that fall.\n\n[^ted]: Ted, our CTO who has since left Allovue, was a huge mentor to me those first three years. He was always generous to my ideas and experience managing software and technical integration projects in a dramatically different environment and helped me to understand how software was built differently in product companies and software consultancies. He always respected and elevated my technical skills, both within our private conversations and with colleagues. I still struggle with feelings of inadequacies in this area, but Ted never hesitated to lift me back up and remind me we all struggle with imposter syndrome. He never made me feel not up to the task, but instead like I had someone to work with to get better. I think it was his idea that I should be made Chief Product Officer, or at least I know that he was strongly consulted about my growing role at Allovue. And when he left Allovue in 2017, he was clear that he felt comfortable doing so in part because of his faith in my ability to take on the leadership of the team he worked hard to build.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/85669d74cf.jpg\" gallery=\"2015\" title=\"Gracie Surveying Her Snow Covered Kingdom\" description=\"Those heavy snow storms that left Downcity deserted were the best.

Elsa's mom moved in with us and brought along with her our second dog, Brandy. Moving was hard. We had just completed redoing our kitchen and bathroom and everything at our condo was just how we liked it. Although Elsa decided to leave her job and was looking for work, the last two years we had started to feel established in our community in Providence. We had solid personal and professional supports. Providence became the home we built together, but it was time to go. In retrospect, I'm glad we left.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/76d567d028.jpg\" gallery=\"2016\" title=\"Camden Yards\" description=\"My whole life, my uncle, dad, and I talked about driving down to Baltimore to see a game at Camden Yards.

I turned 30, and I started to take working out more seriously because years of work travel and neglect made me feel bad. I wanted to get back some of the healthy habits I had built a few years prior when Elsa and I both lost a fair amount of weight. Allovue's CTO Ted left, and I was put in charge of development in addition to design, product management, and data integration. Although we weathered that initial transition well, I think it's only in 2019 that I truly began to feel comfortable with my new role. We also released our first version of our Budget tool, our second major software product. We bought our house in Hampden, Baltimore. For the first time, we have enough room for family and friends to visit and stay with us and we can host holidays. I love our new home and we're building a nice life here. Some of my heart remains in Providence, but Baltimore is nudging its way in. I still don't feel I've built the strong emotional ties to Baltimore I had for Providence, but I'd like to get there someday.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/85ec08e231.jpg\" gallery=\"2017\" title=\"Chilaquiles\" description=\"The best chilaquiles I've ever eaten.

I left two weeks later for a wonderful trip with Elsa and visited East Asia for the first time. When I came home, my grandmother had passed away. A month later, my Uncle Marty, who lived with me throughout my childhood, was gone as well. It was the worst two months of my life. The rest of this year is a blur.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/9ed3e82542.jpg\" gallery=\"2018\" title=\"Gracie and Brandy on my Parent's Stoop\" description=\"Nothing like these faces when you walk up to a house.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f72b4650eb.jpg\" gallery=\"2018\" title=\"Favorite Trees\" description=\"I have a lot of pictures of trees.

We acquired Equiday. We started to put a lot of work into scaling our people and processes and started to work on some still-secret projects that I believe will be the core of our next decade of success. Elsa and I took a wonderful trip to Spain. I failed to keep up with any meaningful physical health routine, but my mental health improved. 2019 is one of the best years I have had in a long time. I rose to meet some major challenges. I traveled more for fun than I have in years. I felt more secure in my friendships, and I felt more secure in my ability to do my job. It took a decade, but at the end of 2019, I'm feeling pretty good about the adult I am still becoming.\n\n<div class='img-gallery'>\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/b425c745f3.jpg\" gallery=\"2019\" title=\"Wyman Park\" description=\"I started this year with a long walk from my house to Charles Village, which takes me through Wyman Park.

Y: The Last Man is a great post-apocalyptic tale and a perennial recommendation from comic readers to someone who as never clicked with the genre.\n\n\n[^sandmanpanel]: I chose this panel from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/265qmx/i_was_reading_the_sandman_and_i_saw_this_panel/\">this Reddit post</a>.\n[^americanvampire]: I chose this panel from <a href=\"https://thiscageisworms.com/2012/04/20/ten-disjointed-thoughts-about-american-vampire/\">this blog post</a> about American Vampire.\n",

We ordered the breakfast set, which came with a delicious macaroni soup with ham. It was a very clean flavor that was somehow both simple and complex. The toast was delicious, as was my fried egg and milk tea. Unfortunately, we did not have French toast. It was absent from the English menus and everything moved too fast.<br /><br />But not to worry! We headed around the corner to another dairy company afterwards. This one was run by all women instead of men, and there we found French toast and toast with peanut butter. It was delicious, although we actually preferred the savory breakfast in the end.</p>\n",

				"title": "How I start my work in R",
				"content_html": "\n\n<h3 id=\"ideation\">Ideation</h3>\n\n<p>At the start of every project, there&rsquo;s a blinking cursor.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s almost never true for me. If I start staring at a blinking cursor, I&rsquo;m almost guaranteed to keep looking at a blinking cursor, often for hours. The real work almost always starts weeks or months before I actually type anything. I think it&rsquo;s easy for folks for whom their ultimate product is a bunch of code or an analysis report to undervalue that our work is creative. Writing a package or doing data analysis is still fundamentally creative work. We&rsquo;re in the business of using computers to generate evidence to support insights into how things work. If all there was to it was a procedural search through models, then this would all have been automated already.</p>\n\n<p>When I think, &ldquo;How do I wish I could write my code to solves this problem?&rdquo; I know that I am getting a great idea for a package. Often, I&rsquo;m staring at a function I just wrote to make my work easier and start to think &ldquo;This is still too specific to my work.&rdquo; I can start to see the steps of generalizing my solution a little bit further. Then I start to see how further generalization of this function will require supporting scaffolding and steps that would have been valuable. I start to think through what other problems exist in data sets unlike my own or future data I expect to work with. And I ask myself again and again, &ldquo;How do I wish I could write my code to solves this problem?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Data analysis almost always starts with an existing hypothesis of interest. My guiding thoughts are &ldquo;What do I need to know to understand this data? What kind of evidence would convince me?&rdquo; Sometimes the first thoughts are how I would model the data, but most of the time I begin to picture 2-3 data visualizations that would present the main results of my work. Nothing I produce is meant to convince an academic audience or even other data professionals of my results. Everything I make is about delivering value back to the folks who generate the data I use in the first place. I am trying to deliver value back to organizations by using data on their current work to inform future work. So my hypotheses are &ldquo;What decisions are they making with this data? What decisions are they making without this data that should be informed by it? How can I analyze and present results to influence and improve both of these processes?&rdquo; The answer to that is rarely a table of model specifications. But even if your audience is one of peer technical experts, I think it&rsquo;s valuable to start with what someone should learn from your analysis and how can you present that most clearly and convincingly to that audience.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t rush this process. If you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re heading, it&rsquo;s hard to do a good job getting there. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that once I <em>do</em> start writing code, I always know exactly what I am going to do. But I find it far easier to design the right data product if I have a few guiding light ideas of what I want to accomplish from the start.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n\n<p>The next step is not writing code, but it may still happen in your code editor of choice. Once I have some concept of where I am headed, I start to write out my ideas for the project in a <code>README.md</code> in a new RStudio project. Now is the time to describe who your work is for and how you expect them to interact with that work. Similar to something like a &ldquo;project charter&rdquo;, your README should talk about what the goals are for the project, what form the project will take (a package? an Rmd -&gt; pdf report? a website? a model to be deployed into production for use in this part of the application?), and who the audience is for the end product. If you&rsquo;re working with collaborators, this is a great way to level-set and build common understanding. If you&rsquo;re not working with collaborators, this is a great way to articulate the scope of the project and hold yourself accountable to that scope. It also is helpful for communicating to managers, mentors, and others who may eventually interact with your work even if they will be less involved at the inception.</p>\n\n<p>For a package, I would write out the primary functions you expect someone to interact with and how those functions interact with each other. Use your first README to specify that this package will have functions to get data from a source, process that data into a more easy to use format, validate that data prior to analysis, and produce common descriptive statistics and visuals that you&rsquo;d want to produce before using that data set for something more complex. That&rsquo;s just an example, but now you have the skeletons for your first functions: <code>fetch</code>, <code>transform</code>, <code>validate</code>, and <code>describe</code>. Maybe each of those functions will need multiple variants. Maybe <code>validate</code> will get folded into a step at <code>fetch</code>. You&rsquo;re not guaranteed to get this stuff right from the start, but you&rsquo;re far more likely to design a clear, clean API made with composable functions that each help with one part of the process if you think this through before writing your first function. Like I said earlier, I often think of writing a package when I look at one of my existing functions and realize I can generalize it further. Who among us hasn&rsquo;t written a monster function that does all of the work of <code>fetch</code>, <code>transform</code>, <code>validate</code>, and <code>describe</code> all at once?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"design-your-data\">Design Your Data</h3>\n\n<p>I always write up a data model at the start of a new project.

				"content_text": "\n### Ideation\n\nAt the start of every project, there's a blinking cursor.\n\nActually, that's almost never true for me. If I start staring at a blinking cursor, I'm almost guaranteed to keep looking at a blinking cursor, often for hours. The real work almost always starts weeks or months before I actually type anything. I think it's easy for folks for whom their ultimate product is a bunch of code or an analysis report to undervalue that our work is creative. Writing a package or doing data analysis is still fundamentally creative work. We're in the business of using computers to generate evidence to support insights into how things work. If all there was to it was a procedural search through models, then this would all have been automated already.\n\nWhen I think, \"How do I wish I could write my code to solves this problem?\" I know that I am getting a great idea for a package. Often, I'm staring at a function I just wrote to make my work easier and start to think \"This is still too specific to my work.\" I can start to see the steps of generalizing my solution a little bit further. Then I start to see how further generalization of this function will require supporting scaffolding and steps that would have been valuable. I start to think through what other problems exist in data sets unlike my own or future data I expect to work with. And I ask myself again and again, \"How do I wish I could write my code to solves this problem?\"\n\nData analysis almost always starts with an existing hypothesis of interest. My guiding thoughts are \"What do I need to know to understand this data? What kind of evidence would convince me?\" Sometimes the first thoughts are how I would model the data, but most of the time I begin to picture 2-3 data visualizations that would present the main results of my work. Nothing I produce is meant to convince an academic audience or even other data professionals of my results. Everything I make is about delivering value back to the folks who generate the data I use in the first place. I am trying to deliver value back to organizations by using data on their current work to inform future work. So my hypotheses are \"What decisions are they making with this data? What decisions are they making without this data that should be informed by it? How can I analyze and present results to influence and improve both of these processes?\" The answer to that is rarely a table of model specifications. But even if your audience is one of peer technical experts, I think it's valuable to start with what someone should learn from your analysis and how can you present that most clearly and convincingly to that audience.\n\nDon't rush this process. If you don't know where you're heading, it's hard to do a good job getting there. That doesn't mean that once I *do* start writing code, I always know exactly what I am going to do. But I find it far easier to design the right data product if I have a few guiding light ideas of what I want to accomplish from the start.\n\n### Design\n\nThe next step is not writing code, but it may still happen in your code editor of choice. Once I have some concept of where I am headed, I start to write out my ideas for the project in a `README.md` in a new RStudio project. Now is the time to describe who your work is for and how you expect them to interact with that work. Similar to something like a \"project charter\", your README should talk about what the goals are for the project, what form the project will take (a package? an Rmd -> pdf report? a website? a model to be deployed into production for use in this part of the application?), and who the audience is for the end product. If you're working with collaborators, this is a great way to level-set and build common understanding. If you're not working with collaborators, this is a great way to articulate the scope of the project and hold yourself accountable to that scope. It also is helpful for communicating to managers, mentors, and others who may eventually interact with your work even if they will be less involved at the inception.\n\nFor a package, I would write out the primary functions you expect someone to interact with and how those functions interact with each other. Use your first README to specify that this package will have functions to get data from a source, process that data into a more easy to use format, validate that data prior to analysis, and produce common descriptive statistics and visuals that you'd want to produce before using that data set for something more complex. That's just an example, but now you have the skeletons for your first functions: `fetch`, `transform`, `validate`, and `describe`. Maybe each of those functions will need multiple variants. Maybe `validate` will get folded into a step at `fetch`. You're not guaranteed to get this stuff right from the start, but you're far more likely to design a clear, clean API made with composable functions that each help with one part of the process if you think this through before writing your first function. Like I said earlier, I often think of writing a package when I look at one of my existing functions and realize I can generalize it further. Who among us hasn't written a monster function that does all of the work of `fetch`, `transform`, `validate`, and `describe` all at once?\n\n### Design Your Data\n\nI always write up a data model at the start of a new project. What are the main data entities I'll be working with? What properties do I expect they will have? How do I expect them to relate to one another? Even when writing a package, I want to think about \"What are the ideal inputs and outputs for this function?\" \n\nImportantly, when what I have in mind is a visualization, I actually fake data and get things working in `ggplot` or `highcharter`, depending on what the final product will be. Why? I want to make sure the visual is compelling with a fairly realistic set of data. I also want to know how to organize my data to make that visualization easy to achieve. It helps me to define the output of my other work far more clearly.\n\nIn many cases, I want to store my data in a database, so I want to start with a simple design of the tables I expect to have, along with validity and referential constraints I want to apply. If I understand what data I will have, how it is related, what are valid values, and how and where I expect the data set to expand, I find it far easier to write useful functions and reproducible work. I think this is perhaps the most unique thing I do and it comes from spending a lot of time thinking about data architectures in general. If I'm analyzing school district data, I want to understand what district level properties and measures I'll have, what school properties and measures I'll have, what student property and measures I'll have, what teacher properties and measures I'll have, etc. Even if the analysis is coming from or will ultimately produce a single, flattened out, big rectangle of data, I crave [normality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).\n\n### Make Files\n\nSo now my README defines a purpose, it talks about how I expect someone to interact with my code or what outputs they should expect from the analysis, and has a description of the data to be used and how it's organized. Only then do I start to write `.R` files in my `R/` directory. Even then I'm probably not writing code but instead pseudocode outlines of how I want things to work, or fake example data to be used later. I'm not much of a [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) person, but the first code I write looks a lot like test data and basic functions that are meeting some test assertions. Here's some small bit of data, can I pass it into this function and get what I want out? What if I create this failure state? What if I can't assume column are right?\n\nWriting code is far more fun when I know where I am heading. So that's how I start my work.\n",

				"title": "This Year in My R Code",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>Looking back on 2017, there were three major trends in my R code: the end of S4, directly writing to SQL database, and <code>purrr</code> everywhere.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-end-of-s4\">The End of S4</h3>\n\n<p>The first package I ever wrote extensively used S4 classes. I wanted to have the security of things like <code>setValidity</code>. I liked the idea of calling <code>new</code> as it felt more like class systems I was familiar with from that one semester of Java in college. S4 felt more grown up than S3, more like it was utilizing the advantages of object oriented programming, and less exotic than R6, which in 2014 felt riskier to build with and teach future employees. Using S4 was a mistake from day one and never led to any advantages in the code I wrote.</p>\n\n<p>So this year, I rewrote that original package. It&rsquo;s internal (and a core function) at my job so I can&rsquo;t share too much, but this was a long time coming. Not only did I clean up a lot of code that was just plain bad (in the way all old code is), but I got rid of S4 in favor of S3 or more functional code wherever possible. Our test coverage is far more complete, the code is far easier to extend without duplication, and it looks far more idiomatic to the standard non-BioConductor R user.</p>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s the lesson learned here? From a technical perspective, it would be avoid premature optimization and, of course, that everyone can and wants to throw out old code they revist with greater knowledge and context. But I know those things. What drove me to making the wrong decision here was purely imposter syndrome. I was writing code that had to be run unattended on a regular basis as a part of a product in a new job. I didn&rsquo;t feel up to the task, so I felt working with a new, complex, scary part of R that promised some notion of &ldquo;safety&rdquo; would mean I really knew what I was doing. So my takeaway from walking away from S4 is this: start small, build what you know, have confidence you can solve problems one at a time, and trust yourself.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"directly-writing-sql\">Directly Writing SQL</h3>\n\n<p>I use SQL far more than R, but almost entirely as a consumer (e.g. <code>SELECT</code> only). I&rsquo;ve almost always directly used SQL for my queries into <em>other people&rsquo;s data</em>, but rarely ventured into the world of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>UPDATE</code> directly, preferring to use interfaces like <code>dbWriteTable</code>. This gets back to imposter syndrome&ndash; there&rsquo;s so little damage that can be done with a <code>SELECT</code> statement, but writing into databases I don&rsquo;t control means taking on risk and responsiblity.</p>\n\n<p>This year I said fuck it&ndash; there&rsquo;s a whole lot of work and complexity going on that&rsquo;s entirely related to me not wanting to write <code>INSERT INTO</code> a PostgreSQL has the amazing <code>ON CONFLICT...</code>-based &ldquo;upserts&rdquo; now. So I started to write a lot of queries, some of them pretty complex <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:lateral\"><a href=\"#fn:lateral\">1</a></sup>. R is a great wrapper language, and it&rsquo;s database story is getting even better with the new DBI, odbc, and RPostgres packages. Although it&rsquo;s native table writing support is a little weak, there&rsquo;s no problem at all just using <code>dbSendStatement</code> with complex queries. I&rsquo;ve fallen into a pattern I really like of writing temporary tables (with <code>dplyr::copy_to</code> because it&rsquo;s clean in a pipeline) and then executing complex SQL with <code>dbSendStatement</code>. In the future, I might be inclined to make these database functions, but either way this change has been great. I feel more confident than ever working with databases and R (my two favorite places to be) and I have been able to simplify a whole lot of code that involved passing around text files (and boy do I hate the type inference and other madness that can happen with CSVs. Oy.).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"purrr\">purrr</h3>\n\n<p>This is the year that <code>purrr</code> not only clicked, but became my preferred way to write code. Where there was <code>apply</code>, now there was <code>purrr</code>. Everything started to look like a list. I&rsquo;m still only scratching the surface here, but I love code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>locations %&gt;%\n  filter(code %in% enrollment$locations) %$%\n  code %&gt;%\n  walk(function(x) render(input = 'schprofiles.Rmd',\n                          html_document(theme = NULL,\n                                        template = NULL,\n                                        self_contained = FALSE,\n                                        css = 'static/styles.css',\n                                        lib_dir = 'cache/demo/output/static/',\n                                        includes = includes('fonts.html')),\n                          params = list(school_code = x),\n                          output_file = paste0(x,'.html'),\n                          output_dir = &quot;cache/demo/output/&quot;))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a simple way to run through all of the <code>locations</code> (a <code>data.frame</code> with columns <code>code</code> and <code>name</code>) and render an HTML-based profile of each school (defined by having student enrollment). <code>walk</code> is beautiful, and so is <code>purrr</code>. I mean, who does need to do <code>map(., mutate_if, is.numeric, as.character)</code> 10 times a day?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2018-r-goals\">2018 R Goals</h2>\n\n<p>One thing that&rsquo;s bittersweet is that 2017 is probably the last year in a long time that writing code is the main thing my every day job is about. With increased responsibility and the growth of my employees, I find myself reviewing code a lot more than writing it, and sometimes not even that. With that in mind, I have a few goals for 2018 that I hope will keep the part of me that loves R engaged.</p>\n\n<p>First, I want to start writing command line utilities using R. I know almost nothing beyond <code>Rscript -e</code> or <code>./script.sh</code> when it comes to writing a CLI. But there are all kinds of tasks I do every day that could be written as small command line scripts. Plus, my favorite part of package authoring is writing interfaces for other people to use.

				"content_text": "\nLooking back on 2017, there were three major trends in my R code: the end of S4, directly writing to SQL database, and `purrr` everywhere.\n\n### The End of S4\n\nThe first package I ever wrote extensively used S4 classes. I wanted to have the security of things like `setValidity`. I liked the idea of calling `new` as it felt more like class systems I was familiar with from that one semester of Java in college. S4 felt more grown up than S3, more like it was utilizing the advantages of object oriented programming, and less exotic than R6, which in 2014 felt riskier to build with and teach future employees. Using S4 was a mistake from day one and never led to any advantages in the code I wrote.\n\nSo this year, I rewrote that original package. It's internal (and a core function) at my job so I can't share too much, but this was a long time coming. Not only did I clean up a lot of code that was just plain bad (in the way all old code is), but I got rid of S4 in favor of S3 or more functional code wherever possible. Our test coverage is far more complete, the code is far easier to extend without duplication, and it looks far more idiomatic to the standard non-BioConductor R user.\n\nWhat's the lesson learned here? From a technical perspective, it would be avoid premature optimization and, of course, that everyone can and wants to throw out old code they revist with greater knowledge and context. But I know those things. What drove me to making the wrong decision here was purely imposter syndrome. I was writing code that had to be run unattended on a regular basis as a part of a product in a new job. I didn't feel up to the task, so I felt working with a new, complex, scary part of R that promised some notion of \"safety\" would mean I really knew what I was doing. So my takeaway from walking away from S4 is this: start small, build what you know, have confidence you can solve problems one at a time, and trust yourself.\n\n### Directly Writing SQL\n\nI use SQL far more than R, but almost entirely as a consumer (e.g. `SELECT` only). I've almost always directly used SQL for my queries into _other people's data_, but rarely ventured into the world of `INSERT` or `UPDATE` directly, preferring to use interfaces like `dbWriteTable`. This gets back to imposter syndrome-- there's so little damage that can be done with a `SELECT` statement, but writing into databases I don't control means taking on risk and responsiblity.\n\nThis year I said fuck it-- there's a whole lot of work and complexity going on that's entirely related to me not wanting to write `INSERT INTO` a PostgreSQL has the amazing `ON CONFLICT...`-based \"upserts\" now. So I started to write a lot of queries, some of them pretty complex [^lateral]. R is a great wrapper language, and it's database story is getting even better with the new DBI, odbc, and RPostgres packages. Although it's native table writing support is a little weak, there's no problem at all just using `dbSendStatement` with complex queries. I've fallen into a pattern I really like of writing temporary tables (with `dplyr::copy_to` because it's clean in a pipeline) and then executing complex SQL with `dbSendStatement`. In the future, I might be inclined to make these database functions, but either way this change has been great. I feel more confident than ever working with databases and R (my two favorite places to be) and I have been able to simplify a whole lot of code that involved passing around text files (and boy do I hate the type inference and other madness that can happen with CSVs. Oy.).\n\n[^lateral]: I let out quite the \"fuck yea!\" when I got that two-common-table-expression, two joins with one lateral join in an upsert query to work.\n\n### purrr\n\nThis is the year that `purrr` not only clicked, but became my preferred way to write code. Where there was `apply`, now there was `purrr`. Everything started to look like a list. I'm still only scratching the surface here, but I love code like this:\n\n```\nlocations %>%\n  filter(code %in% enrollment$locations) %$%\n  code %>%\n  walk(function(x) render(input = 'schprofiles.Rmd',\n                          html_document(theme = NULL,\n                                        template = NULL,\n                                        self_contained = FALSE,\n                                        css = 'static/styles.css',\n                                        lib_dir = 'cache/demo/output/static/',\n                                        includes = includes('fonts.html')),\n                          params = list(school_code = x),\n                          output_file = paste0(x,'.html'),\n                          output_dir = \"cache/demo/output/\"))\n```\n\nIt's a simple way to run through all of the `locations` (a `data.frame` with columns `code` and `name`) and render an HTML-based profile of each school (defined by having student enrollment). `walk` is beautiful, and so is `purrr`. I mean, who does need to do `map(., mutate_if, is.numeric, as.character)` 10 times a day?\n\n## 2018 R Goals\n\nOne thing that's bittersweet is that 2017 is probably the last year in a long time that writing code is the main thing my every day job is about. With increased responsibility and the growth of my employees, I find myself reviewing code a lot more than writing it, and sometimes not even that. With that in mind, I have a few goals for 2018 that I hope will keep the part of me that loves R engaged.\n\nFirst, I want to start writing command line utilities using R. I know almost nothing beyond `Rscript -e` or `./script.sh` when it comes to writing a CLI. But there are all kinds of tasks I do every day that could be written as small command line scripts. Plus, my favorite part of package authoring is writing interfaces for other people to use. How do I expect someone to want to use R and reason about a problem I'm helping to solve? It's no wonder that I work on product every day with this interest. So I figure one way to keep engaged in R is to learn how to design command line utilities in R and get good at it. Rather than write R code purely intended to be called and used from R, my R code is going to get an interface this year.\n\nLike every year, I'd like to keep up with this blog. I never do, but this year I had a lot of encouraging signs. I actually got considerable attention for every R-related post (high hundreds of views), so I think it's time to lean into that. I'm hoping to write one R related post each week. I think the focus will help me have some chance of pulling this off. Since I also want to keep my R chops alive while I move further and further away from day to day programming responsibilities, it should be a two birds with one stone scenario. One major thing I haven't decided-- do I want to submit to r-bloggers? I'm sure it'd be a huge source of traffic, but I find it frustrating to have to click through from my RSS reader of choice when finding things there.\n\nLastly, I'd like to start to understand the internals of a core package I use every day. I haven't decided what that'll be. Maybe it'll be something really fundamental like `dplyr`, `DBI`, or `ggplot2`. Maybe it'll be something \"simpler\". But I use a lot more R code than I read. And one thing I've learned every time I've forced myself to dig in is that I understand more R than I thought and also that reading code is one of the best ways to learn more. I want to do at least one deep study that advances my sense of self-R-worth. Maybe I'll even have to take the time to learn a little C++ and understand how Rccp is being used to change the R world.\n\n### Special Thanks\n\nThe #rstats world on Twitter has been the only reason I can get on that service anymore.

Almost all the work I&rsquo;ve done in R in the last 7 years has interacted with databases in some way. What was new for this project is that the database would not be remote, but instead would be running alongside my code in a linked Docker container.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-quick-step-back-about-docker\">A quick step back about Docker</h2>\n\n<p>Docker is something you use if you want to be cool on Hacker News. But Docker is also a great way to have a reproducible environment to run your code in, from the operating system up. A full review of Docker is beyond the scope of this post (maybe <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/what-container\">check this out</a>), but I would think of it like this: if you run your code in a Docker container, you can guarantee your code works because you&rsquo;re creating a reproducible environment that can be spun up anywhere. Think of it like making an R package instead of writing an analysis script. Installing the package means you get all your dependency packages and have confidence the functions contained within will work on different machines. Docker takes that to the next level and includes operating system level dependencies like drivers and network configurations in addition to just the thing your R functions use.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"some-challenges-with-testing-in-r\">Some challenges with testing in R</h2>\n\n<p>Like many folks, I use <code>devtools</code> and <code>testthat</code> extensively when developing packages. I strive for as-near-as-feasible 100% coverage with my tests, and I am constantly hitting Cmd + Shift + T while writing code in RStudio or running <code>devtools::test()</code>. I even use <code>Check</code> in the Build pane in RStudio and <code>goodpractice::gp()</code> to keep me honest even if my code won&rsquo;t make it to CRAN. But I ran into a few things working with CircleCI running my tests inside of a docker container that pushed me to learn a few critical pieces of information about testing in R.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"achieving-exit-status-1\">Achieving exit status 1</h3>\n\n<p>Only two ways of running tests (that I can tell) will result in a returning an exit status code of 1 (error in Unix systems) and therefore cause a build to fail in a continuous integration system. Without that exit status, failing tests won&rsquo;t fail a build, so don&rsquo;t run <code>devtools::test()</code> and think you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>\n\n<p>This means using <code>R CMD build . &amp;&amp; R CMD check *tar.gz</code> or <code>testthat::test_package($MY_PACKAGE)</code> are your best bet in most cases. I prefer using <code>testthat::test_package()</code> because <code>R CMD check</code> cuts off a ton of useful information about test failures without digging into the <code>*.Rcheck</code> folder. Since I want to see information about test failures directly in my CI tool, this is a pain. Also, although not released yet, because <code>testthat::test_package()</code> supports alternative reporters, I can have jUnit output, which plays very nicely with many CI tools.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"methods-for-s4\">Methods for S4</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>methods</code> package is not loaded using <code>Rscript -e</code>, so if you use <code>S4</code> classes make sure you call <code>library(methods);</code> as part of your tests. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:methods\"><a href=\"#fn:methods\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"environment-variables-and-r-cmd-check\">Environment Variables and R CMD check</h3>\n\n<p>When using <code>R CMD check</code> and other functions that call to that program, your environment variables from the OS may not &ldquo;make it&rdquo; through to R. That means calls to <code>Sys.getenv()</code> when using <code>devtools::test()</code> might work, but using <code>testthat::test_package()</code> or <code>R CMD check</code> may fail.</p>\n\n<p>This was a big thing I ran into. The way I know the host address and port to talk to in the database container running along side my code is using environment variables. All of my tests that were testing against a test database containers were failing for a while and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why. The key content was on <a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html\">this page about R startup</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>R CMD check and R CMD build do not always read the standard startup files, but they do always read specific Renviron files. The location of these can be controlled by the environment variables R_CHECK_ENVIRON and R_BUILD_ENVIRON. If these are set their value is used as the path for the Renviron file; otherwise, files ‘~/.R/check.Renviron’ or ‘~/.R/build.Renviron’ or sub-architecture-specific versions are employed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it turns out I had to get my environment variables of interest into the <code>R_CHECK_ENVIRON</code>. At first I tried this by using <code>env &gt; ~/.R/check.Renviron</code> but it turns out that <code>docker run</code> runs commands as <code>root</code>, and R doesn&rsquo;t like that very much. Instead, I had to specify <code>R_CHECK_ENVIRON=some_path</code> and then used <code>env &gt; $R_CHECK_ENVIRON</code> to make sure that my environment variables were available during testing.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I have everything set up quite nice. Here are some snippets that might help.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"circle-yml\">circle.yml</h2>\n\n<p>At the top I specify my <code>R_CHECK_ENVIRON</code></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yml\">machine:\n  services:\n    - docker\n  environment:\n    R_CHECK_ENVIRON: /var/$MY_PACKAGE/check.Renviron\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I run my actual tests roughly like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-yml\">test:\n  override:\n    - docker run --link my_database_container -it -e R_CHECK_ENVIRON=$R_CHECK_ENVIRON my_container:my_tag /bin/bash ./scripts/run_r_tests.sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Docker adds critical environment variables to the container when using <code>--link</code> that point to the host and port I can use to find the database container.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"run-r-tests-sh\">run_r_tests.sh</h2>\n\n<p>I use a small script that takes care of dumping my environment properly and sets me up to take advantage of <code>test_package()</code>&rsquo;s reporter option rather than directly writing my commands in line with <code>docker run</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">#! /bin/bash\n# dump environment into R check.Renviron\nenv &gt; /var/my_package/check.Renviron\n\nRscript -e &quot;library(devtools);devtools::install();library(testthat);library(my_package);test_package('my_package', reporter = 'Summary')&quot;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not convinced I need to do either the <code>install()</code> step or <code>library(my_package)</code>. Also, you can run <code>R CMD build . &amp;&amp; R CMD check *tar.gz</code> instead of using the <code>Rscript</code> line. I am also considering copying the <code>.Rcheck</code> folder to <code>$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS</code> so that I can download it as desired. To do that, you can just add:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir -p $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/test_results\ncp -r *.Rcheck $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/test_results\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope that some of this information is useful if you&rsquo;re thinking about mixing R, continuous integration, and Docker. If not, at least when I start searching the internet for this information next time, at least this post will show up and remind me of what I used to know.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:methods\">This is only a problem for my older packages.

Also, although not released yet, because `testthat::test_package()` supports alternative reporters, I can have jUnit output, which plays very nicely with many CI tools.\n\n### Methods for S4\n\nThe `methods` package is not loaded using `Rscript -e`, so if you use `S4` classes make sure you call `library(methods);` as part of your tests. [^methods]\n\n[^methods]: This is only a problem for my older packages. I've long since decided S4 is horrible and not worth it. Just use S3, although R6 looks very attractive.\n\n### Environment Variables and R CMD check\n\nWhen using `R CMD check` and other functions that call to that program, your environment variables from the OS may not \"make it\" through to R. That means calls to `Sys.getenv()` when using `devtools::test()` might work, but using `testthat::test_package()` or `R CMD check` may fail.\n\nThis was a big thing I ran into. The way I know the host address and port to talk to in the database container running along side my code is using environment variables. All of my tests that were testing against a test database containers were failing for a while and I couldn't figure out why. The key content was on [this page about R startup](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html). \n\n> R CMD check and R CMD build do not always read the standard startup files, but they do always read specific Renviron files. The location of these can be controlled by the environment variables R_CHECK_ENVIRON and R_BUILD_ENVIRON. If these are set their value is used as the path for the Renviron file; otherwise, files ‘~/.R/check.Renviron’ or ‘~/.R/build.Renviron’ or sub-architecture-specific versions are employed.\n\nSo it turns out I had to get my environment variables of interest into the `R_CHECK_ENVIRON`. At first I tried this by using `env > ~/.R/check.Renviron` but it turns out that `docker run` runs commands as `root`, and R doesn't like that very much. Instead, I had to specify `R_CHECK_ENVIRON=some_path` and then used `env > $R_CHECK_ENVIRON` to make sure that my environment variables were available during testing.\n\nIn the end, I have everything set up quite nice. Here are some snippets that might help.\n\n## circle.yml\n\nAt the top I specify my `R_CHECK_ENVIRON`\n\n```yml\nmachine:\n  services:\n    - docker\n  environment:\n    R_CHECK_ENVIRON: /var/$MY_PACKAGE/check.Renviron\n```\n\nI run my actual tests roughly like so:\n\n```yml\ntest:\n  override:\n    - docker run --link my_database_container -it -e R_CHECK_ENVIRON=$R_CHECK_ENVIRON my_container:my_tag /bin/bash ./scripts/run_r_tests.sh\n```\n\nDocker adds critical environment variables to the container when using `--link` that point to the host and port I can use to find the database container. \n\n## run_r_tests.sh\n\nI use a small script that takes care of dumping my environment properly and sets me up to take advantage of `test_package()`'s reporter option rather than directly writing my commands in line with `docker run`.\n\n```bash\n#! /bin/bash\n# dump environment into R check.Renviron\nenv > /var/my_package/check.Renviron\n\nRscript -e \"library(devtools);devtools::install();library(testthat);library(my_package);test_package('my_package', reporter = 'Summary')\"\n```\n\nTo be honest, I'm not convinced I need to do either the `install()` step or `library(my_package)`. Also, you can run `R CMD build . && R CMD check *tar.gz` instead of using the `Rscript` line. I am also considering copying the `.Rcheck` folder to `$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS` so that I can download it as desired. To do that, you can just add:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/test_results\ncp -r *.Rcheck $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/test_results\n```\n\nI hope that some of this information is useful if you're thinking about mixing R, continuous integration, and Docker. If not, at least when I start searching the internet for this information next time, at least this post will show up and remind me of what I used to know.\n",

In this toy case, you could use `group_by_(params$school)`, but it's pretty easy to run into limitations with the `_` functions in `dplyr` when writing functions.\n\nUsing `wrapr::let`, I can easily use the code above:\n\n```r\nlet(alias = params, {\n    create_per_pupil <- . %>%\n                        group_by(school) %>%\n                        summarize(per_pupil = sum(amount)/n)\n})\n\npp <- district_data %>%\n      create_per_pupil\n```\n\nThe core of `wrapr::let` is really scary.\n\n```r\nbody <- strexpr\nfor (ni in names(alias)) {\n    value <- as.character(alias[[ni]])\n    if (ni != value) {\n        pattern <- paste0(\"\\\\b\", ni, \"\\\\b\")\n        body <- gsub(pattern, value, body)\n    }\n}\nparse(text = body)\n```\n\nBasically let is holidng onto the code block contained within it, iterating over the list of key-value pairs that are provided, and then runs a `gsub` on word boundaries to replace all instances of the list names with their values. Yikes.\n\nThis works, I use it all over, but I have never felt confident about it.\n\n## The New World of tidyeval\n\nThe release of dplyr 0.6 along with tidyeval brings wtih it a ton of features to making programming over dplyr functions far better supported. I am going to [read this page](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) by Hadley Wickham at least 100 times. There are all kinds of new goodies (`!!!` looks amazing).\n\nSo how would I re-write the chain above sans `let`?\n\n```r\ncreate_per_pupil <- . %>%\n                    group_by(!!sym(school)) %>%\n                    summarize(per_pupil = sum(amount)/n)\n```\n\nIf I understand `tidyeval`, then this is what's going on.\n\n* `sym` evaluates `school` and makes the result a `symbol`\n* and `!!` says, roughly \"evaluate that symbol now\".\n\nThis way with `params$school` having the value `\"school_name\"`, `sym(school)` creates evaulates that to `\"school_name\"` and then makes it an unquoted symbol `school_name`. Then `!!` tells R \"You can evaluate this next thing in place as it is.\"\n\nI originally wrote this post trying to understand `enquo`, but I never got it to work right and it makes no sense to me yet. What's great is that `rlang::sym` and `rlang::syms` with `!!` and `!!!` respectively work really well so far. There is definitely less flexibility-- with the full on `quosure` stuff you can have very complex evaluations. But I'm mostly worried about having very generic names for my data so `sym` and `syms` seems to work great.\n",

So I may have a FIPS code <code>data.frame</code> with <code>fips_code</code> and <code>name</code> as the columns or a user <code>data.frame</code> with columns <code>id</code>, <code>fname</code>, <code>lname</code>, <code>email</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In a database, I might have a foreign key constraint on my table that just has codes so that I could not create a row that uses an <code>id</code> or <code>code</code> value or whatever that did not exist in my lookup table. Of course in R, our data is disconnected and non-relational. New users may exist in my dataset that weren&rsquo;t there the last time I downloaded the <code>users</code> table, for example.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ok-so-these-are-just-collections-of-enumerated-values\">Ok, so these are just collections of enumerated values</h2>\n\n<p>Yup! That&rsquo;s right! In some ways like R&rsquo;s <em>beloved</em> <code>factors</code>, I want to have problems when my data contains values that don&rsquo;t have a corresponding row in another <code>data.frame</code>, just like trying to insert a value into a <code>factor</code> that isn&rsquo;t an existing level.</p>\n\n<p><code>assertr</code> anticipates just this, with the <code>in_set</code> helper. This way I can <code>assert</code> that my data is in a defined set of values or get an error.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">my_df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(0,1,1,2))\nassert(my_df, in_set(0,1), x)\n# Column 'x' violates assertion 'in_set(0, 1)' 1 time\n#   index value\n# 1     4     2\n# Error: assertr stopped execution\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"please-don-t-stop\">Please Don&rsquo;t stop()</h2>\n\n<p>By default, <code>assert</code> raises an error with an incredibly helpful message. It tells you which column the assertion was on, what the assertion was, how many times that assertion failed, and then returns the column index and value of the failed cases.</p>\n\n<p>Even better, <code>assert</code> has an argument for <code>error_fun</code>, which, combined with some built in functions, can allow for all kinds of fun behavior when an assertion fails. What if, for example, I actually want to collect that error message for later and not have a hard stop if an assertion failed?</p>\n\n<p>By using <code>error_append</code>, <code>assert</code> will return the original <code>data.frame</code> when there&rsquo;s a failure with a special attribute called <code>assertr_errors</code> that can be accessed later with all the information about failed assertions.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">my_df %&lt;&gt;%\n  assert(in_set(0,1), x, error_fun = error_append) %&gt;%\n  verify(x == 1, error_fun = error_append)\nmy_df\n#   x\n# 1 0\n# 2 1\n# 3 1\n# 4 2\nattr(my_df, 'assertr_errors')\n# [[1]]\n# Column 'x' violates assertion 'in_set(0, 1)' 1 time\n#   index value\n# 1     4     2\n# \n# [[2]]\n# verification [x == 1] failed! (2 failures)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Ok I cheated there folks. I used <code>verify</code>, a new function from <code>assertr</code> and a bunch of <code>magrittr</code> pipes like <code>%&lt;&gt;%</code>)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"enough-with-the-toy-examples\">Enough with the toy examples</h2>\n\n<p>Ok, so here&rsquo;s the code I wrote today. This started as a huge mess I ended up turning into two functions. First <code>is_valid_fk</code> provides a straight forward way to get <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> on whether or not all of your codes/ids exist in a lookup <code>data.frame</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">is_valid_fk &lt;- function(data, key, values,\n                        error_fun = error_logical,\n                        success_fun = success_logical){\n\n  assert_(data, in_set(values), key,\n          error_fun = error_fun, success_fun = success_fun)\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first argument <code>data</code> is your <code>data.frame</code>, the second argument <code>key</code> is the foreign key column in <code>data</code>, and <code>values</code> are all valide values for <code>key</code>. Defaulting the <code>error_fun</code> and <code>success_fun</code> to <code>*_logical</code> means a single boolean is the expected response.</p>\n\n<p>But I don&rsquo;t really want to do these one column at a time. I want to check if all of the foreign keys in a table are good to go. I also don&rsquo;t want a boolean, I want to get back all the errors in a useable format. So I wrote <code>all_valid_fk</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take it one bit at a time.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">all_valid_fk &lt;- function(data, fk_list, id = 'code') {\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>data</code> is the <code>data.frame</code> we&rsquo;re checking foreign keys in.</li>\n<li><code>fk_list</code> is a list of <code>data.frames</code>. Each element is named for the <code>key</code> that it looks up; each <code>data.frame</code> contains the valid values for that <code>key</code> named&hellip;</li>\n<li><code>id</code>, the name of the column in each <code>data.frame</code> in the list <code>fk_list</code> that corresponds to the valid <code>keys</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">verify(data, do.call(has_all_names, as.list(names(fk_list))))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Right away, I want to know if my data has all the values my <code>fk_list</code> says it should. I have to do some <code>do.call</code> magic because <code>has_all_names</code> wants something like <code>has_all_names('this', 'that', 'the_other')</code> not <code>has_all_names(c('this', 'that', 'the_other')</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The next part is where the magic happens.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">accumulated_errors &lt;- map(names(fk_list),\n                            ~ is_valid_fk(data,\n                                          key = .x,\n                                          values = fk_list[[.x]][[id]],\n                                          error_fun = error_append,\n                                          success_fun = success_continue)) %&gt;%\n                        map(attr, 'assertr_errors') %&gt;%\n                        reduce(append)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using <code>map</code>, I am able to call <code>is_valid_fk</code> on each of the columns in <code>data</code> that have a corresponding lookup table in <code>fk_list</code>. The valid values are <code>fk_list[[.x]][[id]]</code>, where <code>.x</code> is the name of the <code>data.frame</code> in <code>fk_list</code> (which corresponds to the name of the code we&rsquo;re looking up in <code>data</code> and exists for sure, thanks to that <code>verify</code> call) and <code>id</code> is the name of the key in that <code>data.frame</code> as stated earlier. I&rsquo;ve replaced <code>error_fun</code> and <code>success_fun</code> so that the code does not exist <code>map</code> as soon there are any problems. Instead, the data is returned for each assertion with the error attribute if one exists. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:memory\"><a href=\"#fn:memory\">2</a></sup> Immediately, <code>map</code> is called on the resulting list of <code>data.frame</code>s to collect the <code>assertr_errors</code>, which are <code>reduce</code>d using <code>append</code> into a flattened list.</p>\n\n<p>If there are no errors accumulated, <code>accumulated_errors</code> is <code>NULL</code>, and the function exits early.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">if(is.null(accumulated_errors)) return(list())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I could have stopped here and returned all the messages in <code>accumulated_errors</code>. But I don&rsquo;t like all that text, I want something neater to work with later. The structure I decided on was a list of <code>data.frame</code>s, with each element named for the column with the failed foreign key assertion and the contents being the index and value that failed the constraint.</p>\n\n<p>By calling <code>str</code> on <code>data.frame</code>s returned by assertion, I was able to see that the <code>index</code> and <code>value</code> tables printed in the failed <code>assert</code> messages are contained in <code>error_df</code>. So next I extract each of those <code>data.frame</code>s into a single list.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">reporter &lt;- accumulated_errors %&gt;%\n            map('error_df') %&gt;%\n            map(~ map_df(.x, as.character)) # because factors suck\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m almost done. I have no way of identifying which column created each of those <code>error_df</code> in <code>reporter</code>. So to name each element based on the column that failed the foreign key contraint, I have to extract data from the <code>message</code> attribute. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">names(reporter) &lt;- accumulated_errors %&gt;%\n                   map_chr('message') %&gt;%\n                   gsub(&quot;^Column \\'([a-zA-Z]+)\\' .*$&quot;, '\\\\1', x = .)\nreporter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So let&rsquo;s create some fake data and run <code>all_valid_fk</code> to see the results:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">&gt; df &lt;- data.frame(functions = c('1001','1002', '3001', '3002'),\n                   objects = c('100','102', '103', '139'),\n                   actuals = c(10000, 2431, 809, 50000),\n                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n&gt; chart &lt;- list(functions = data.frame(code = c('1001', '1002', '3001'),\n                                       name = c('Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz'),\n                                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE),\n                objects =   data.frame(code = c('100', '102', '103'),\n                                       name = c('Mom', 'Dad', 'Baby'),\n                                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE))\n&gt; all_valid_fk(data = df, fk_list = chart, id = 'code')\n$functions\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  index value\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1     4  3002\n\n$objects\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  index value\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1     4   139\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Beautiful!</p>\n\n<p>And here&rsquo;s <code>all_valid_fk</code> in one big chunk.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">all_valid_fk &lt;- function(data, fk_list, id = 'code') {\n  verify(data, do.call(has_all_names, as.list(names(fk_list))))\n\n  accumulated_errors &lt;- map(names(fk_list),\n                            ~ is_valid_fk(data,\n                                          key = .x,\n                                          values = fk_list[[.x]][[id]],\n                                          error_fun = error_append,\n                                          success_fun = success_continue)) %&gt;%\n                        map(attr, 'assertr_errors') %&gt;%\n                        reduce(append)\n\n  if(is.null(accumulated_errors)) return(list())\n\n  reporter &lt;- accumulated_errors %&gt;%\n              map('error_df') %&gt;%\n              map(~ map_df(.x, as.character))\n\n  names(reporter) &lt;- accumulated_errors %&gt;%\n                     map_chr('message') %&gt;%\n                     gsub('Column \\'(\\\\S*?)\\'.*$', '\\\\1', x = .)\n  reporter\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>My thanks to <a href=\"https://jcarroll.com.au\">Jonathan Carroll</a> who was kind enough to read this post closely and actually tried to run the code.

This way I can `assert` that my data is in a defined set of values or get an error.\n\n```r\nmy_df <- data.frame(x = c(0,1,1,2))\nassert(my_df, in_set(0,1), x)\n# Column 'x' violates assertion 'in_set(0, 1)' 1 time\n#   index value\n# 1     4     2\n# Error: assertr stopped execution\n```\n\n## Please Don't stop()\n\nBy default, `assert` raises an error with an incredibly helpful message. It tells you which column the assertion was on, what the assertion was, how many times that assertion failed, and then returns the column index and value of the failed cases.\n\nEven better, `assert` has an argument for `error_fun`, which, combined with some built in functions, can allow for all kinds of fun behavior when an assertion fails. What if, for example, I actually want to collect that error message for later and not have a hard stop if an assertion failed?\n\nBy using `error_append`, `assert` will return the original `data.frame` when there's a failure with a special attribute called `assertr_errors` that can be accessed later with all the information about failed assertions.\n\n```r\nmy_df %<>%\n  assert(in_set(0,1), x, error_fun = error_append) %>%\n  verify(x == 1, error_fun = error_append)\nmy_df\n#   x\n# 1 0\n# 2 1\n# 3 1\n# 4 2\nattr(my_df, 'assertr_errors')\n# [[1]]\n# Column 'x' violates assertion 'in_set(0, 1)' 1 time\n#   index value\n# 1     4     2\n# \n# [[2]]\n# verification [x == 1] failed! (2 failures)\n```\n\n(Ok I cheated there folks. I used `verify`, a new function from `assertr` and a bunch of `magrittr` pipes like `%<>%`)\n\n## Enough with the toy examples\n\nOk, so here's the code I wrote today. This started as a huge mess I ended up turning into two functions. First `is_valid_fk` provides a straight forward way to get `TRUE` or `FALSE` on whether or not all of your codes/ids exist in a lookup `data.frame`.\n\n\n```r\nis_valid_fk <- function(data, key, values,\n                        error_fun = error_logical,\n                        success_fun = success_logical){\n\n  assert_(data, in_set(values), key,\n          error_fun = error_fun, success_fun = success_fun)\n\n}\n```\n\nThe first argument `data` is your `data.frame`, the second argument `key` is the foreign key column in `data`, and `values` are all valide values for `key`. Defaulting the `error_fun` and `success_fun` to `*_logical` means a single boolean is the expected response.\n\nBut I don't really want to do these one column at a time. I want to check if all of the foreign keys in a table are good to go. I also don't want a boolean, I want to get back all the errors in a useable format. So I wrote `all_valid_fk`.\n\nLet's take it one bit at a time. \n\n```r\nall_valid_fk <- function(data, fk_list, id = 'code') {\n```\n\n1. `data` is the `data.frame` we're checking foreign keys in.\n2. `fk_list` is a list of `data.frames`. Each element is named for the `key` that it looks up; each `data.frame` contains the valid values for that `key` named...\n3. `id`, the name of the column in each `data.frame` in the list `fk_list` that corresponds to the valid `keys`.\n\n```r\nverify(data, do.call(has_all_names, as.list(names(fk_list))))\n```\n\nRight away, I want to know if my data has all the values my `fk_list` says it should. I have to do some `do.call` magic because `has_all_names` wants something like `has_all_names('this', 'that', 'the_other')` not `has_all_names(c('this', 'that', 'the_other')`.\n\nThe next part is where the magic happens.\n\n```r\naccumulated_errors <- map(names(fk_list),\n                            ~ is_valid_fk(data,\n                                          key = .x,\n                                          values = fk_list[[.x]][[id]],\n                                          error_fun = error_append,\n                                          success_fun = success_continue)) %>%\n                        map(attr, 'assertr_errors') %>%\n                        reduce(append)\n```\nUsing `map`, I am able to call `is_valid_fk` on each of the columns in `data` that have a corresponding lookup table in `fk_list`. The valid values are `fk_list[[.x]][[id]]`, where `.x` is the name of the `data.frame` in `fk_list` (which corresponds to the name of the code we're looking up in `data` and exists for sure, thanks to that `verify` call) and `id` is the name of the key in that `data.frame` as stated earlier. I've replaced `error_fun` and `success_fun` so that the code does not exist `map` as soon there are any problems. Instead, the data is returned for each assertion with the error attribute if one exists. [^memory] Immediately, `map` is called on the resulting list of `data.frame`s to collect the `assertr_errors`, which are `reduce`d using `append` into a flattened list.\n\nIf there are no errors accumulated, `accumulated_errors` is `NULL`, and the function exits early.\n\n```r\nif(is.null(accumulated_errors)) return(list())\n```\n\nI could have stopped here and returned all the messages in `accumulated_errors`. But I don't like all that text, I want something neater to work with later. The structure I decided on was a list of `data.frame`s, with each element named for the column with the failed foreign key assertion and the contents being the index and value that failed the constraint. \n\nBy calling `str` on `data.frame`s returned by assertion, I was able to see that the `index` and `value` tables printed in the failed `assert` messages are contained in `error_df`. So next I extract each of those `data.frame`s into a single list.\n\n```r\nreporter <- accumulated_errors %>%\n            map('error_df') %>%\n            map(~ map_df(.x, as.character)) # because factors suck\n```\n\nI'm almost done. I have no way of identifying which column created each of those `error_df` in `reporter`. So to name each element based on the column that failed the foreign key contraint, I have to extract data from the `message` attribute. Here's what I came up with.\n\n```r\nnames(reporter) <- accumulated_errors %>%\n                   map_chr('message') %>%\n                   gsub(\"^Column \\'([a-zA-Z]+)\\' .*$\", '\\\\1', x = .)\nreporter\n```\n\nSo let's create some fake data and run `all_valid_fk` to see the results:\n\n```r\n> df <- data.frame(functions = c('1001','1002', '3001', '3002'),\n                   objects = c('100','102', '103', '139'),\n                   actuals = c(10000, 2431, 809, 50000),\n                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n> chart <- list(functions = data.frame(code = c('1001', '1002', '3001'),\n                                       name = c('Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz'),\n                                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE),\n                objects =   data.frame(code = c('100', '102', '103'),\n                                       name = c('Mom', 'Dad', 'Baby'),\n                                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE))\n> all_valid_fk(data = df, fk_list = chart, id = 'code')\n$functions\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  index value\n  <chr> <chr>\n1     4  3002\n\n$objects\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  index value\n  <chr> <chr>\n1     4   139\n```\n\nBeautiful!\n\nAnd here's `all_valid_fk` in one big chunk.\n\n```r\nall_valid_fk <- function(data, fk_list, id = 'code') {\n  verify(data, do.call(has_all_names, as.list(names(fk_list))))\n\n  accumulated_errors <- map(names(fk_list),\n                            ~ is_valid_fk(data,\n                                          key = .x,\n                                          values = fk_list[[.x]][[id]],\n                                          error_fun = error_append,\n                                          success_fun = success_continue)) %>%\n                        map(attr, 'assertr_errors') %>%\n                        reduce(append)\n\n  if(is.null(accumulated_errors)) return(list())\n\n  reporter <- accumulated_errors %>%\n              map('error_df') %>%\n              map(~ map_df(.x, as.character))\n\n  names(reporter) <- accumulated_errors %>%\n                     map_chr('message') %>%\n                     gsub('Column \\'(\\\\S*?)\\'.*$', '\\\\1', x = .)\n  reporter\n}\n```\n\n_My thanks to [Jonathan Carroll](https://jcarroll.com.au) who was kind enough to read this post closely and actually tried to run the code. As a result, I've fixed a couple of typos and now have an improved regex pattern above._\n\n[^missing]: I appear to have forgotten to build link post types into my Hugo blog, so the missing link from that post is [here](http://4dpiecharts.com/2015/07/03/the-state-of-assertions-in-r/).\n[^memory]: I am a little concerned about memory here. Eight assertions would mean, at least briefly, eight copies of the same `data.frame` copied here without the need for that actual data. There is probably a better way.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>One of my goals for 2017 is to contribute more to the R open source community. At the beginning of last year, I spent a little time helping to refactor <a href=\"https://www.github.com/leeper/rio\">rio</a>. It was one of the more rewarding things I did in all of 2016. It wasn&rsquo;t a ton of work, and I feel like I gained a lot of confidence in writing R packages and using S3 methods. I wrote code that R users download and use thousands of times a month.</p>\n\n<p>I have been on the lookout for a Javascript powered interactive charting library since <code>ggvis</code> was announced in 2014. But <code>ggvis</code> seems to have stalled out in favor of other projects (for now) and the evolution of <code>rCharts</code> into <code>htmlwidgets</code> left me feeling like there were far too many options and no clear choices.</p>\n\n<p>What I was looking for was a plotting library to make clean, attractive graphics with tool tips that came with clear documentation and virtually no knowledge of Javascript required. Frankly, all of the <code>htmlwidgets</code> stuff was very intimidating. From my vantage point skimming blog posts and watching stuff come by on Twitter, <code>htmlwidgets</code>-based projects all felt very much directed at Javascript polyglots.</p>\n\n<p>Vega and Vega-Lite had a lot of the qualities I sought in a plotting library. Reading and writing JSON is very accessible compared to learning Javascript, especially with R&rsquo;s excellent translation from lists to JSON. And although I know almost no Javascript, I found in both Vega and Vega-Lite easy to understand documents that felt a lot like building grammar of graphics <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:thegg\"><a href=\"#fn:thegg\">1</a></sup> plots.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to take the plunge&ndash; there was a <code>vegalite</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite\">package</a> and the examples didn&rsquo;t look so bad. It was time to use my first <code>htmlwidgets</code> package.</p>\n\n<p>Things went great. I had some simple data and I wanted to make a bar chart.

				"content_text": "\nOne of my goals for 2017 is to contribute more to the R open source community. At the beginning of last year, I spent a little time helping to refactor [rio](https://www.github.com/leeper/rio). It was one of the more rewarding things I did in all of 2016. It wasn't a ton of work, and I feel like I gained a lot of confidence in writing R packages and using S3 methods. I wrote code that R users download and use thousands of times a month.\n\nI have been on the lookout for a Javascript powered interactive charting library since `ggvis` was announced in 2014. But `ggvis` seems to have stalled out in favor of other projects (for now) and the evolution of `rCharts` into `htmlwidgets` left me feeling like there were far too many options and no clear choices.\n\nWhat I was looking for was a plotting library to make clean, attractive graphics with tool tips that came with clear documentation and virtually no knowledge of Javascript required. Frankly, all of the `htmlwidgets` stuff was very intimidating. From my vantage point skimming blog posts and watching stuff come by on Twitter, `htmlwidgets`-based projects all felt very much directed at Javascript polyglots.\n\nVega and Vega-Lite had a lot of the qualities I sought in a plotting library. Reading and writing JSON is very accessible compared to learning Javascript, especially with R's excellent translation from lists to JSON. And although I know almost no Javascript, I found in both Vega and Vega-Lite easy to understand documents that felt a lot like building grammar of graphics [^thegg] plots.\n\n[^thegg]: The `gg` in `ggplot2`.\n\nSo I decided to take the plunge-- there was a `vegalite` [package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite) and the examples didn't look so bad. It was time to use my first `htmlwidgets` package.\n\nThings went great. I had some simple data and I wanted to make a bar chart. I wrote:\n\n```r\nvegalite() %>%\nadd_data(my_df) %>%\nencode_x('schools', type = 'nominal') %>%\nencode_y('per_pupil', type = 'quantitative') %>%\nmark_bar()\n```\n\nA bar chart was made! But then I wanted to use the font Lato, which is what we use at [Allovue](http://www.allovue.com). No worries, Vega-Lite has a property called `titleFont` for axes. So I went to do:\n\n```r\nvegalite() %>%\nadd_data(my_df) %>%\nencode_x('schools', type = 'nominal') %>%\nencode_y('per_pupil', type = 'quantitative') %>%\nmark_bar() %>%\naxis_x(titleFont = 'Lato')\n```\n\nBummer. It didn't work. I almost stopped there, experiment over. But then I remembered my goal and I thought, maybe I need to learn to contribute to a package that is an `htmlwidget` and not simply use an `htmlwidget`-based package. I should at least _look_ at the code.\n\nWhat I found surprised me. Under the hood, all the R package does is build up lists. It makes so much sense-- pass JSON to Javascript to process and do what's needed.\n\nSo it turned out, `vegalite` for R was a bit behind the current version of `vegalite` and didn't have the `titleFont` property yet. And with that, I made my [first commit](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite/commit/8f4d4db057985bac4fc8c5743780b4746dd56c56). All I had to do was update the function definition and add the new arguments to the axis data like so:\n\n```r\nif (!is.null(titleFont))    vl$x$encoding[[chnl]]$axis$titleFont <- titleFont\n```\n\nBut why stop there? I wanted to update all of `vegalite` to use the newest available arguments. Doing so looked like a huge pain though. The original package author made these great functions like `axis_x` and `axis_y`. They both had the same arguments, the only difference was the \"channel\" was preset as `x` or `y` based on which function was called. Problem was that all of the arguments, all of the assignments, and all of the documentation had to be copied twice. It was worse with `encode` and `scale` which had many, many functions that are similar or identical in their \"signature\". No wonder the package was missing so many Vega-Lite features-- they were a total pain to add.\n\nSo as a final step, I decided I would do a light refactor across the whole package. In each of the core functions, like `encode` and `axis`, I would write a single generic function like `encode_vl()` that would hold all of the possible arguments for the [encoding portion](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/encoding.html) of Vega-Lite. Then the specific functions like `encode_x` could become wrapper functions that internally call `encode_vl` like so:\n\n```r\nencode_x <- function(vl, ...) {\n  vl <- encode_vl(vl, chnl = \"x\", ...)\n  vl\n}\n\nencode_y <- function(vl, ...) {\n  vl <- encode_vl(vl, chnl =\"y\", ...)\n  vl\n}\n\nencode_color <- function(vl, ...) {\n  vl <- encode_vl(vl, chnl = \"color\", ...)\n  vl\n}\n```\n\nNow, in order to update the documentation and the arguments for `encoding`, I just have to update the `encode_vl` function. It's a really nice demonstration, in my opinion, of the power of R's `...` syntax. All of the wrapper functions can just pass whatever additional arguments the caller wants to `encode_vl` without having to explicitly list them each time.\n\nThis greatly reduced duplication in the code and made it far easier to update `vegalite` to the newest version of Vega-Lite, which I also decided to do.\n\nNow Vega-Lite itself is embarking on a 2.0 release that I have a feeling will have some pretty big changes in store.

So instead of needing to buy a Logitech Harmony Hub with complex encryption and specialized SiriKit/HomeKit skills, and tight integration, my existing Harmony Hub that has an API used by Logitech&rsquo;s own application supports Alexa skills. An Alexa skill can be built in a day. Apple is allergic to doing simple services like this well, even though the entire web runs on them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-dot\">My Dot</h2>\n\n<p>Our new bedroom in Baltimore does not have recessed lighting much like our old bedroom. We&rsquo;re using one of those inexpensive, black tower lamps in the bedroom. I don&rsquo;t have a switch for the outlets in there. Philips doesn&rsquo;t make any Hue bulbs that provides enough light to light the room with one lamp.</p>\n\n<p>I needed an instant way to get the light on and off. That&rsquo;s when I remembered I had an old WeMo bought from before the days of HomeKit. I used that WeMo to have a simple nightly schedule (turn some lights on at sundown and off at midnight each night) and never really thought about it. The WeMo was perfect, and lo and behold, it works with Alexa. Our Echo is a bit far from the bedroom though, and I don&rsquo;t want to shout across the house to turn off the lights.</p>\n\n<p>Not only was the inexpensive Echo Dot perfectly for sprinkling a little voice in the bedroom, it also meant our master bathroom can have Hue lights that are controlled with voice again. And, now I have a way to get Spotify onto my Kanto YU5 speakers in the bedroom without fussing with Bluetooth<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:dumpsterfire\"><a href=\"#fn:dumpsterfire\">6</a></sup> from my phone by just connecting an 1/8&rdquo; phono plug in permanently.</p>\n\n<p>Now we say &ldquo;Alexa, turn on the bedroom light&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexa, play Jazz for Sleep&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s great. It always works. If we had a guest bedroom with the same setup, anyone who stayed there would be able to use it just as easily. No wonder why the Wynn is <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/14/wynn-las-vegas-to-add-amazon-alexa-to-all-hotel-rooms.html\">putting Amazon Echo in their hotel</a>. Apple literally can&rsquo;t do that.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whither-voice-control\">Whither Voice Control</h2>\n\n<p>Amazon, Apple, and Google seemed locked in a battle over voice <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:microsoft\"><a href=\"#fn:microsoft\">7</a></sup>.

Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple AirPods are all about maximizing (1). Siri works pretty well when I&rsquo;m out with the dogs and need a quick bit of information or to make a call. But the truth is, I don&rsquo;t really need to learn a lot from Siri on those dog walks. When I&rsquo;m out walking, Siri is better than pulling out my phone, but once I&rsquo;ve got a podcast or music going I don&rsquo;t really need anything from Siri in those moments.</p>\n\n<p>Driving is another great context for voice control. I can&rsquo;t look much at a screen and shouldn&rsquo;t anyway. Ignoring CarPlay, Apple&rsquo;s real move here is Bluetooth interfaces, which places Siri in most cars. But again, what is my real use for voice control in this scenario? Reading SMS and iMessages makes for a cool demo, but not really something I need. Getting directions to a location by name is probably the best use here, but Apple&rsquo;s location database is shit for this. Plus, most of the time I choose where I am going when I get in the car, when I can still use my screen and would prefer to. The most important use of voice control in the car is calling a contact, which Voice Control, the on-device precursor to Siri, did just fine. <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2016/ford-working-on-amazon-echo-integration-connecting-cars-to-homes/\">And now Alexa is entering the car space too</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While cooking, it is great to be able to set timers, convert measurement units, and change music or podcast while my hands are occupied. This is why so many people place their Amazon Echo in the kitchen&ndash; it works great for these simple task. &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; and a Bluetooth speaker is a terrible solution in comparison. In fact, one thing that the Amazon Echo has done is cause me to wear my headphones less while cooking or doing the dishes, since the Amazon Echo works better and doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t hear Elsa in the other room. This isn&rsquo;t a killer feature though. Early adopters may be all about the $180 kitchen timer with a modest speaker, but the Echo won&rsquo;t be a mass product if this is its best value proposition.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"shared-interface-to-shared-devices\">Shared Interface to Shared Devices</h2>\n\n<p>There is a reason why home automation is where the Echo shines. Our homes are full of technology: light switches, appliances, televisions and all the boxes that plug in them, and everyone who enters the home has cause to control them. We expect that basically all home technology is reasonably transparent to anyone inside. Everyone knows how to lock and unlock doors, turn on the TV, turn on and off lights, or adjust the thermostat. Home automation has long been a geek honey pot that angers every cohabitant and visitor, but voice control offers an interface as easy and common as a light switch.</p>\n\n<p>Home automation is the early adopter use case that reveals how and why voice control is a compelling user interface. Turning on the bedroom lights means saying &ldquo;Alexa, turn on the bedroom lights.&rdquo; There is no pause for Siri to be listening. There is no taking out my phone or lifting up my watch. There is no invite process. There is no worrying about guests being confused. Anyone inside my home has always been able to hit a light switch. Anyone inside my home can say &ldquo;Alexa, turn on the living room lights.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why Apple erred by not having a lower security, proximity based way to control HomeKit devices.</p>\n\n<p>Voice control is great because it provides a shared interface to devices that are shared by multiple people. Computers, smartphones, and really most screen-based interfaces that we use are the aberration, pushing toward and suggesting that technology is becoming more personal. The world we actually live in is filled with artifacts that are communal, and as computer and information technology grow to infuse into the material technologies of our lives, we need communal interfaces.

Plus, who cares what Apple has to say about any of this if we're not talking about rich people? Apple's market is rich people and that isn't going to change. Affordable luxury is the brand and target, where affordable in the global scheme means fairly well off.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When I entered high school, video games were beginning to lose their appeal. So I sold my four video game systems and all their games at a garage sale and that money, plus some Chanukkah money, bought me my first guitar and amp. I had just tried joined a band as a singer with a couple of guys I knew from school. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about playing guitar. In fact, it took me a while to figure out what distortion was and why I my guitar didn&rsquo;t sound like Kris Roe from The Ataris.</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning, being in a band was rough. We had a lot of fun playing together, but just keeping time and making it all the way through a song was a slog. We had agreed I wouldn&rsquo;t try playing guitar with the band until I had been playing at least three months, self-taught. But this was 2001 and I lived on Long Island and we were playing pop-punk, so it didn&rsquo;t take too long to catch up. Soon I was writing music, actual original music. To this day, I don&rsquo;t really enjoy playing other people&rsquo;s music, because from the moment I picked up a guitar it was an instrument for creating new music with other people.</p>\n\n<p>Writing music was a kind of awful torture I was addicted to. For years, I was absorbing how music sounded. I used to listen so intently that I memorized whole compositions. I wanted to hear every strike of a kick drum, every open string ringing out, every tapped bass note, and every quiet piano layered in deep below the mix. But now that I was writing music, I became become obsessed with its construction. All the nuances I worked hard to hear in music took on a whole new layer of depth as I tried unravel how the song was made. I never heard music the same way again. But my appreciation for the craft of songwriting far exceeded the meager results a few months of having a stratocaster glued to my hands could produce. I would meet and practice with just one of the other members of the band for hours long writing sessions where we would struggle to create something good enough to bring to the rest of the guys and flesh out into a full song. But eventually, within a couple of years, we wrote about 15 songs, at least six or seven of which I was pretty proud of. It was so difficult to write those first songs. It took so many hours at home alone, then working hard with one or two other guys to write new parts and determine a structure, and then eventually months of practice with four guys sweating in a basement practicing the same music over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted so badly to write my song.</p>\n\n<p>Every band has one. Their song. The real one. The song that every musician who hears your album recognizes immediately as the song that trancends the talent of the individuals involved and is just plain better. It&rsquo;s not the most complex song. It may not even be the most overtly emotional. It&rsquo;s probably not your single. But it&rsquo;s the song that stands out as a proud announcement to the people like me, the musicians who absorb every sound and experience the very structure of the music. Transcendent, to repeat myself, is really the best explanation for it. These are the songs that shook my soul, and I wanted to find mine.</p>\n\n<p>I never did write my song. I ended up quitting that first band after two and a half years and playing with a different set of guys for a bit over year chasing &ldquo;my song&rdquo;. I hoped a different writing experience with different musicians might help. Throughout college, I still played guitar all the time, but I never got comfortable writing without collaborators and I never found the right people to fulfill that role. Nowadays I pick up a guitar so rarely. I hear a phrase in a song I love and immediately know I can play it and sometimes get the urge to actually prove that to myself. Once a year, the foggy edges of a song appears in the distance, enticing me to chase it for a short while, and I record a small phrase to add to the library of forgotten riffs and lyrics.</p>\n\n<p>I still listen to music, though not as often and not really the same kinds anymore. And I still can&rsquo;t listen the way I used to, the way it was before I picked up a guitar and tried singing into a microphone.

				"content_text": "\nWhen I entered high school, video games were beginning to lose their appeal. So I sold my four video game systems and all their games at a garage sale and that money, plus some Chanukkah money, bought me my first guitar and amp. I had just tried joined a band as a singer with a couple of guys I knew from school. I didn't know anything about playing guitar. In fact, it took me a while to figure out what distortion was and why I my guitar didn't sound like Kris Roe from The Ataris.\n\nIn the beginning, being in a band was rough. We had a lot of fun playing together, but just keeping time and making it all the way through a song was a slog. We had agreed I wouldn't try playing guitar with the band until I had been playing at least three months, self-taught. But this was 2001 and I lived on Long Island and we were playing pop-punk, so it didn't take too long to catch up. Soon I was writing music, actual original music. To this day, I don't really enjoy playing other people's music, because from the moment I picked up a guitar it was an instrument for creating new music with other people.\n\nWriting music was a kind of awful torture I was addicted to. For years, I was absorbing how music sounded. I used to listen so intently that I memorized whole compositions. I wanted to hear every strike of a kick drum, every open string ringing out, every tapped bass note, and every quiet piano layered in deep below the mix. But now that I was writing music, I became become obsessed with its construction. All the nuances I worked hard to hear in music took on a whole new layer of depth as I tried unravel how the song was made. I never heard music the same way again. But my appreciation for the craft of songwriting far exceeded the meager results a few months of having a stratocaster glued to my hands could produce. I would meet and practice with just one of the other members of the band for hours long writing sessions where we would struggle to create something good enough to bring to the rest of the guys and flesh out into a full song. But eventually, within a couple of years, we wrote about 15 songs, at least six or seven of which I was pretty proud of. It was so difficult to write those first songs. It took so many hours at home alone, then working hard with one or two other guys to write new parts and determine a structure, and then eventually months of practice with four guys sweating in a basement practicing the same music over and over again.\n\nI wanted so badly to write my song.\n\nEvery band has one. Their song. The real one. The song that every musician who hears your album recognizes immediately as the song that trancends the talent of the individuals involved and is just plain better. It's not the most complex song. It may not even be the most overtly emotional. It's probably not your single. But it's the song that stands out as a proud announcement to the people like me, the musicians who absorb every sound and experience the very structure of the music. Transcendent, to repeat myself, is really the best explanation for it. These are the songs that shook my soul, and I wanted to find mine.\n\nI never did write my song. I ended up quitting that first band after two and a half years and playing with a different set of guys for a bit over year chasing \"my song\". I hoped a different writing experience with different musicians might help. Throughout college, I still played guitar all the time, but I never got comfortable writing without collaborators and I never found the right people to fulfill that role. Nowadays I pick up a guitar so rarely. I hear a phrase in a song I love and immediately know I can play it and sometimes get the urge to actually prove that to myself. Once a year, the foggy edges of a song appears in the distance, enticing me to chase it for a short while, and I record a small phrase to add to the library of forgotten riffs and lyrics.\n\nI still listen to music, though not as often and not really the same kinds anymore. And I still can't listen the way I used to, the way it was before I picked up a guitar and tried singing into a microphone. That part of me is permanently broken in a way I expect only musicians can understand.\n\nI learned something important about myself in my time as a musician. When I'm chasing something I truly love, I don't feelsome great pleasure. Writing music was about throwing myself into an agonizing chase for the impossible. It was the euphoria of the small accomplishments-- a good song performed on stage in front of a crowd that actually responds to your creation, or cracking how to transition from a verse to a chorus-- that kept me going. And it was the imprint on my life, mind and soul, that brought me true joy from being a musician as time went on.\n\nWorking on product at Allovue feels like writing music.

I don&rsquo;t have a Facebook page, because I don&rsquo;t trust Facebook and how it repeatedly changed and confused privacy settings and after college, I rarely found that Facebook was a net positive in my life.

But the barrier to posting a blog post has always felt high to me. A blog feels somewhat permanent. It&rsquo;s something I want my current and future employers and friends to read it. It&rsquo;s a record of ideas that felt worthy of memorializing. I have tried over and over again to lower this perceived barrier to blogging and failed.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I find the quick ability to favorite/like, retweet/re-broadcast, and respond on Twitter to be addicting. It is so easy to give feedback and join a conversation. As a result, I&rsquo;ve probably written more, 140 characters at a time, on Twitter than I ever have on this blog.</p>\n\n<p>For me, Twitter is an ephemeral medium. It is about instant conversation and access. What I dump into Twitter doesn&rsquo;t have any lasting power, which is why it&rsquo;s so easy to toss out thoughts. Twitter is my new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a>, not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging\">microblog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Writing on Twitter in 140 characters often seems to attract the worst in people. It&rsquo;s not just #gamergate, it&rsquo;s me. My ideas are more sarcastic, more acerbic, and less well considered because Twitter feels like an off the cuff conversation among friends. But it&rsquo;s not a conversation among friends. It&rsquo;s not really even a conversation. It&rsquo;s a bunch of people shouting at each other in the same room. Twitter is less a late night dorm room debate and more the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me to Tumblr, a service I think I finally understand. Tumblr is Twitter, but for people who take a breath before shouting. It has the same rich post types that Twitter has implemented through Cards. It has the same ability to magnify posts I find interesting through its reblogging feature. It also has the same ability to send a bit of encouragement and acknowledgement through its hearts. But Tumblr also doesn&rsquo;t have the limitation of 140 characters, so I can spread my thoughts out just a bit further. And Tumblr does have a reply/conversation mechanism, but it&rsquo;s just slightly “heavier” feeling than a Twitter reply so I&rsquo;m less likely to just shoot off my mouth with the first thoughts that come to mind. Though Tumblr is a hosted service, it also has a fairly good API that can be used to export posts and the ability to use a custom URL. I could generate more post types on my Pelican blog, but a self-hosted blog lacks some of the social features that are just fun. And the truth is, do I really want to just put a link to a song I&rsquo;m listening to right now on my blog? Is that kind of ephemera really worthy of a blog post? Maybe, but that&rsquo;s not the kind of blog I want.</p>\n\n<p>So I am going back to Tumblr. I have been experimenting for a couple of days and I really like having a place to dump a link or a funny picture. I don&rsquo;t want Tumblr to host my blog, but I do want Tumblr to eat into some of my Twitter posting. I can easily syndicate Tumblr posts over to Twitter, so why not take a little more space and <em>breathe</em> before deciding it is worth sharing something.</p>\n\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://tumblr.jsonbecker.com\">follow me on Tumblr</a>.

I am not clear) owned. The state will lease the land underneath the stadium (the real value) with an option to buy for 30 years at $1 a year. The state will also pay $5,000,000 rent for the stadium itself annually for 30 years. The PawSox will then lease back the stadium at $1,000,000 per year. The net result will be the stadium is built and Rhode Island pays the PawSox owners $4,000,000 a year for 30 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-good\">The Good</h3>\n\n<p>Privately financing the upfront cost of the stadium puts risks of construction delays and cost overruns on the PawSox. Already they are underestimating the cost of moving a gas line below the park grounds. Whatever the cost of construction, whatever the impact on the team of a late opening, the costs to the state are fixed. There is essentially no risk in this plan for taxpayers, defining risk as a technical term for uncertainty. We know what this deal means: $120,000,000 over 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>The interest rate is pretty low. Basically, although the risk is privatized, we should view this stadium as the PawSox providing the state of Rhode Island a loan of $85,000,000 which we will pay back at a rate of approximate 1.15% <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:interest\"><a href=\"#fn:interest\">1</a></sup>. Now just because the interest is low doesn&rsquo;t mean we should buy&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>The stadium design is largely attractive, even if the incorporated lighthouse is drawing ire. I don&rsquo;t mind it, but I do like the idea of replacing it with an Anchor has some Greater City Providence commenters have recommended. Overall, I think the design fits with the neighborhood. It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in pretty renderings.</p>\n\n<p>The pedestrian bridge remains and is accessible. As someone who lives in Downcity, I am very much looking forward to this dramatic improvement to my personal transit. I think the bridge&rsquo;s importance for transit is underrated, although admittedly we could make Point Street Bridge friendlier to pedestrians and bike riders instead.</p>\n\n<p>Brown University seems interested in hosting events, like football games, at the stadium. The plan also seems to give the state a lot of leeway in holding various events in the space when it&rsquo;s not used for the baseball season. It could really be a great event space from mid-April until early November each year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-bad\">The Bad</h3>\n\n<p>Even the team&rsquo;s own economic estimates only foresee $2,000,000 in increased tax revenues. Although they claim this estimate is conservative, I would take that with a huge grain of salt. You do not lead with a plan that straight up says the taxpayers will be out $60,000,000 over 30 years unless you don&rsquo;t have a better foot to put forward. I am going to go ahead and assume this estimate is about right. It&rsquo;s certainly in the ballpark. (Ugh.) But what that means is that Rhode Islanders should understand this is <em>not an investment</em>. This is not like building transit infrastructure or tax stabilization agreements to spur private construction. This deal is more akin to building schools. We do not, in fact cannot, expect that the economic impact makes this project a net positive for revenues. With $12,000,000 expected in direct spending, the project could be net positive for GDP, but even then it is obvious this is not the best annual investment to grow the economy. It is easy to come up with a laundry list of projects that cost less than this that could create more economic activity and/or more revenue to the state and city. Therefore, the project should be viewed primarily on use value. Will Rhode Islanders get $4,000,000 a year in value from the pleasure of using (and seeing) this stadium and its surrounding grounds? In school construction, we expect the benefits to be short term job creation, long term impacts on student health and well-being, ability to learn, and our ability to attract quality teachers. But most of those benefits are diffuse and hard to capture. Ultimately, we mostly support school construction because of the use benefits the kids and teachers see each year.</p>\n\n<p>The time line is crazy. If they&rsquo;re serious about a June decision, they&rsquo;re nuts. We have a complicated budget process ongoing right now. We have a teacher contract in Providence to negotiate. We have a brand new I-195 Commission trying to make their mark and get cranes in the sky. There&rsquo;s no way a negotiation in good faith can be completed in 60 days unless they agree to every counter. If this is a &ldquo;final best offer&rdquo;, essentially, due to time line, then it is disingenuous.</p>\n\n<p>What happens in 30 years? We don&rsquo;t have any guarantees of being whole in 30 years, and the same threats and challenges posed by the PawSox today will come up again in 30 years. Are we committed to a series of handouts until the team is of no monetary or cultural value?</p>\n\n<p>Other cities are likely going to come into play. The PawSox don&rsquo;t have to negotiate a deal that&rsquo;s fair for Rhode Island. They just have to negotiate to a deal that&rsquo;s comparable to an offer they think someone else will make. Rhode Island&rsquo;s position is weak, provided that anyone else is willing to make a deal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-strange\">The Strange</h3>\n\n<p>The PawSox are asking for a 30-year property tax exemption. There&rsquo;s a lot to think through here. First, there are at least two parcels that were meant to be tax generating that are a part of this plan&ndash; the land Brown&rsquo;s Continuing Education building currently sits on and the small develop-able parcel that was cut out from the park for a high value hotel or similar use. The stadium wants both of these parcels in addition to the park. I think City Council President Aponte is being a bit silly talking about being &ldquo;made whole&rdquo; over this deal, unless he&rsquo;s talking about those two parcels. The park land was never going to generate city tax revenue and was actually going to cost the city money to maintain. Part of my openness to any proposal on this park land is my lack of confidence that the city will invest appropriately to maintain a world-class park space along the waterfront. There&rsquo;s very little &ldquo;whole&rdquo; to be made.</p>\n\n<p>It is also possible that Providence will have to designate additional park space if the stadium is built. If that&rsquo;s true and it&rsquo;s coming off the tax roles than the PawSox absolutely should have to pay property taxes, period. There&rsquo;s one possible exception I&rsquo;ll address below&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>I also feel very strongly about having a single process for tax stabilization across all I-195 land that is not politically driven but instead a matter of administrative decision. Exceptions for a big project breaks the major benefit of a single tax stabilization agreement ruling all the I-195 land, which is our need to send a signal that all players are equal, all developers are welcome, and political cronyism is not the path required to build. While some of those $2,000,000 in tax benefits will accrue to Providence through increased surrounding land value, many costs associated with the stadium will as well. There are police details, road wear and tear, fire and emergency services, and more to consider.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"my-counter\">My Counter</h3>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think this deal is dead, but I am not sure that the PawSox, city, or state would accept my counter. I have struggled with whether I should share what I <em>want</em> to happen versus what I think a deal that <em>would</em> happen looks like. I would be tempted to personally just let the PawSox walk. But if Rhode Island really wants them to stay, here&rsquo;s a plausible counter:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The PawSox receive the same tax stabilization agreement all other developers get from the city of Providence. Terms for a fair valuation of the property are agreed upon up front that are derived from some portion of an average of annual revenues.</li>\n<li>The lease terms should be constructed such that the net cost (excluding the anticipated increase in tax receipts) is equal to the tax dollars owed to the city of Providence. Therefore, the state essentially pays for the $85,000,000 of principal and the city taxes. This could be through a PILOT, but I&rsquo;d prefer that amount go to the PawSox and the PawSox transfer the dollars to the city. It&rsquo;s just accounting, but I prefer the symbol of them paying property taxes. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a terrible precedent for the state to offer PILOT payments to cover a gap between the city TSA in I-195 with a developer&rsquo;s ask, if the state sees there is substantial public interest in that investment, but still better to actually get developers used to writing a check to the city.</li>\n<li>If the city has to make additional green space equivalent to the park we are losing, I foresee two options. First is the PawSox paying full load on whatever that land value is. The second is probably better, but harder to make happen. Brown should give up the Brown Stadium land to the city. They can make it into a park without reducing the foot print of taxable property in the city. If they did this, Brown should essentially get free use of the stadium with no fees (except police detail or similar that they would pay for their games on the East Side) in perpetuity. They should get first rights after the PawSox games themselves.</li>\n<li>The stadium itself will be reverted to ownership by the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority if the option to buy the land is not exercised in 30 years. This way the whole stadium and its land are state owned, since the state paid for it. The possible exception would be if Brown has to give up its stadium to park land, in which case I might prefer some arrangement be made with them.</li>\n<li>The PawSox ownership agrees to pay a large penalty to the state and the city if they move the team out of Rhode Island in the next 99 years.</li>\n<li>PawSox maintenance staff will be responsible for maintaining the Riverwalk park, stadium grounds, and the green-way that has been proposed for the I-195 district. Possible we can expand this to something like the Downcity Improvement District (or perhaps just have them pay to expand the DID into the Knowledge District). This will help ensure this creates more permanent jobs and reduces costs to the city for maintaining its public spaces that contribute to the broader attractiveness of the stadium.</li>\n<li>There should be a revenue share deal for any non-PawSox game events with the city and/or state for concession purchases and parking receipts.</li>\n<li>The stadium should not be exempt from future TIF assessments for infrastructure in the area.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am not sure that I would pay even that much for the stadium, but this would be a far better deal overall. I can absolutely think of better ways to spend state dollars, but I also realize that the trade-off is not that simple. Rhode Island is not facing a windfall of $85,000,000 and trying to decide what to do with it. A stadium that keeps the PawSox in Rhode Island inspires emotion. The willingness to create these dollars for this purpose may be far higher than alternative uses. The correct counterfactual is not necessarily supporting 111 Westminster (a better plan for less). It is not necessarily better school buildings. It is not necessarily meaningful tax benefits for rooftop solar power. It is not lowering taxes, building a fund to provide seed capital to local startups, a streetcar, dedicated bus and/or bike lanes, or tax benefits to fill vacant properties and homes. The correct counterfactual could be nothing. It could be all of these things, but in much smaller measure. It is very hard to fully evaluate this proposal because we are not rational actors with a fixed budget line making marginal investment decisions. Ultimately, with big flashy projects like this, I lean toward evaluating them on their own merits. Typically, and I think this case is no exception, even evaluating a stadium plan on its own merits without considering alternative investments makes it clear these projects are bad deals. Yet cities and states make them over and over again. We would be wise to look at this gap in dollars and cents and our collective, repeated actions not as fits of insanity but instead as stark reminders of our inability to simply calculate the total benefits that all people receive.</p>\n\n<p>In my day job, I get to speak to early stage investors. There I learned an important tidbit&ndash; a company can name whatever valuation they want if an investor can control the terms. That&rsquo;s my feeling with the PawSox. The cash is important, it&rsquo;s not nothing. But any potential plan should be judged by the terms.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Rhode Island isn&rsquo;t willing to accept bad terms at a high cost.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:interest\">$A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$ where $A = $120,000,000$, $P = $85,000,000$, $n = 1$, and $t = 30$.

I am going to go ahead and assume this estimate is about right. It's certainly in the ballpark. (Ugh.) But what that means is that Rhode Islanders should understand this is *not an investment*. This is not like building transit infrastructure or tax stabilization agreements to spur private construction. This deal is more akin to building schools. We do not, in fact cannot, expect that the economic impact makes this project a net positive for revenues. With $12,000,000 expected in direct spending, the project could be net positive for GDP, but even then it is obvious this is not the best annual investment to grow the economy. It is easy to come up with a laundry list of projects that cost less than this that could create more economic activity and/or more revenue to the state and city. Therefore, the project should be viewed primarily on use value. Will Rhode Islanders get $4,000,000 a year in value from the pleasure of using (and seeing) this stadium and its surrounding grounds? In school construction, we expect the benefits to be short term job creation, long term impacts on student health and well-being, ability to learn, and our ability to attract quality teachers. But most of those benefits are diffuse and hard to capture. Ultimately, we mostly support school construction because of the use benefits the kids and teachers see each year.\n\nThe time line is crazy. If they're serious about a June decision, they're nuts. We have a complicated budget process ongoing right now. We have a teacher contract in Providence to negotiate. We have a brand new I-195 Commission trying to make their mark and get cranes in the sky. There's no way a negotiation in good faith can be completed in 60 days unless they agree to every counter. If this is a \"final best offer\", essentially, due to time line, then it is disingenuous.\n\nWhat happens in 30 years? We don't have any guarantees of being whole in 30 years, and the same threats and challenges posed by the PawSox today will come up again in 30 years. Are we committed to a series of handouts until the team is of no monetary or cultural value?\n\nOther cities are likely going to come into play. The PawSox don't have to negotiate a deal that's fair for Rhode Island. They just have to negotiate to a deal that's comparable to an offer they think someone else will make. Rhode Island's position is weak, provided that anyone else is willing to make a deal. \n\n### The Strange\n\nThe PawSox are asking for a 30-year property tax exemption. There's a lot to think through here. First, there are at least two parcels that were meant to be tax generating that are a part of this plan-- the land Brown's Continuing Education building currently sits on and the small develop-able parcel that was cut out from the park for a high value hotel or similar use. The stadium wants both of these parcels in addition to the park. I think City Council President Aponte is being a bit silly talking about being \"made whole\" over this deal, unless he's talking about those two parcels. The park land was never going to generate city tax revenue and was actually going to cost the city money to maintain. Part of my openness to any proposal on this park land is my lack of confidence that the city will invest appropriately to maintain a world-class park space along the waterfront. There's very little \"whole\" to be made. \n\nIt is also possible that Providence will have to designate additional park space if the stadium is built. If that's true and it's coming off the tax roles than the PawSox absolutely should have to pay property taxes, period. There's one possible exception I'll address below...\n\nI also feel very strongly about having a single process for tax stabilization across all I-195 land that is not politically driven but instead a matter of administrative decision. Exceptions for a big project breaks the major benefit of a single tax stabilization agreement ruling all the I-195 land, which is our need to send a signal that all players are equal, all developers are welcome, and political cronyism is not the path required to build. While some of those $2,000,000 in tax benefits will accrue to Providence through increased surrounding land value, many costs associated with the stadium will as well. There are police details, road wear and tear, fire and emergency services, and more to consider.\n\n### My Counter\n\nI don't think this deal is dead, but I am not sure that the PawSox, city, or state would accept my counter. I have struggled with whether I should share what I *want* to happen versus what I think a deal that *would* happen looks like. I would be tempted to personally just let the PawSox walk. But if Rhode Island really wants them to stay, here's a plausible counter:\n\n1. The PawSox receive the same tax stabilization agreement all other developers get from the city of Providence. Terms for a fair valuation of the property are agreed upon up front that are derived from some portion of an average of annual revenues.\n2. The lease terms should be constructed such that the net cost (excluding the anticipated increase in tax receipts) is equal to the tax dollars owed to the city of Providence. Therefore, the state essentially pays for the $85,000,000 of principal and the city taxes. This could be through a PILOT, but I'd prefer that amount go to the PawSox and the PawSox transfer the dollars to the city. It's just accounting, but I prefer the symbol of them paying property taxes. I don't think it's a terrible precedent for the state to offer PILOT payments to cover a gap between the city TSA in I-195 with a developer's ask, if the state sees there is substantial public interest in that investment, but still better to actually get developers used to writing a check to the city.\n3. If the city has to make additional green space equivalent to the park we are losing, I foresee two options. First is the PawSox paying full load on whatever that land value is. The second is probably better, but harder to make happen. Brown should give up the Brown Stadium land to the city. They can make it into a park without reducing the foot print of taxable property in the city. If they did this, Brown should essentially get free use of the stadium with no fees (except police detail or similar that they would pay for their games on the East Side) in perpetuity. They should get first rights after the PawSox games themselves.\n4. The stadium itself will be reverted to ownership by the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority if the option to buy the land is not exercised in 30 years. This way the whole stadium and its land are state owned, since the state paid for it. The possible exception would be if Brown has to give up its stadium to park land, in which case I might prefer some arrangement be made with them.\n5. The PawSox ownership agrees to pay a large penalty to the state and the city if they move the team out of Rhode Island in the next 99 years.\n6. PawSox maintenance staff will be responsible for maintaining the Riverwalk park, stadium grounds, and the green-way that has been proposed for the I-195 district. Possible we can expand this to something like the Downcity Improvement District (or perhaps just have them pay to expand the DID into the Knowledge District). This will help ensure this creates more permanent jobs and reduces costs to the city for maintaining its public spaces that contribute to the broader attractiveness of the stadium.\n7. There should be a revenue share deal for any non-PawSox game events with the city and/or state for concession purchases and parking receipts.\n8. The stadium should not be exempt from future TIF assessments for infrastructure in the area.\n\nI am not sure that I would pay even that much for the stadium, but this would be a far better deal overall. I can absolutely think of better ways to spend state dollars, but I also realize that the trade-off is not that simple. Rhode Island is not facing a windfall of $85,000,000 and trying to decide what to do with it. A stadium that keeps the PawSox in Rhode Island inspires emotion. The willingness to create these dollars for this purpose may be far higher than alternative uses. The correct counterfactual is not necessarily supporting 111 Westminster (a better plan for less). It is not necessarily better school buildings. It is not necessarily meaningful tax benefits for rooftop solar power. It is not lowering taxes, building a fund to provide seed capital to local startups, a streetcar, dedicated bus and/or bike lanes, or tax benefits to fill vacant properties and homes. The correct counterfactual could be nothing. It could be all of these things, but in much smaller measure. It is very hard to fully evaluate this proposal because we are not rational actors with a fixed budget line making marginal investment decisions. Ultimately, with big flashy projects like this, I lean toward evaluating them on their own merits. Typically, and I think this case is no exception, even evaluating a stadium plan on its own merits without considering alternative investments makes it clear these projects are bad deals. Yet cities and states make them over and over again. We would be wise to look at this gap in dollars and cents and our collective, repeated actions not as fits of insanity but instead as stark reminders of our inability to simply calculate the total benefits that all people receive.\n\nIn my day job, I get to speak to early stage investors. There I learned an important tidbit-- a company can name whatever valuation they want if an investor can control the terms. That's my feeling with the PawSox. The cash is important, it's not nothing. But any potential plan should be judged by the terms. \n\nHere's hoping Rhode Island isn't willing to accept bad terms at a high cost.\n\n[^interest]: $A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$ where $A = $120,000,000$, $P = $85,000,000$, $n = 1$, and $t = 30$. I'll leave you to the algebra.\n",

We could post pictures, show locations and dates, lyrics, and pretend like we produced music people cared about. It was mostly a fun way for me to play with the web and something to show folks when I said I played guitar and sang in a band. One day, my friend canceled his hosting. He wasn't using his site for anything and he forgot that I had been using the site. I was 18, I never thought about backups, and I had long deleted all those pesky photos taking up space on my memory cards and small local hard drive.\n\nFour years of photos from some of the best experiences of my life are gone. No one had copies. Everyone was using the site. In the decade since, no set of pictures has ever been as valuable as the ones I lost that day.\n\n## Who controls the past...\n\nAs you can imagine, this loss has had a profound effect on how I think about both my data and the permanence of the internet. Today, I have a deep system of backups for any digital data I produce, and I am far more likely to err on keeping data than discarding it. Things still sometimes go missing.

				"content_html": "<p>There are some basic facts about the teacher labor market that are <em>inconvenient</em> for many folks working to improve education. I am going to go through a few premises that I think should be broadly accepted and several lemma and contentions that I hope clarifies my own view on education resources and human capital management.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Teaching in low performing schools is challenging.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I am looking for a job, all else being equal, I will generally not choose the more challenging one.</p>\n\n<p>Some may object to the idea that teachers would not accept a position that offers a greater opportunity to make a difference, for example, teaching at an inner city school, over one that was less likely to have an impact, like teaching in a posh, suburban neighborhood. It is certainly true that some teachers, if not most teachers place value on making a greater impact. However, the question is how great is that preference? How much less compensation (not just wage) would the median teacher be willing to take to work in a more challenging environment?</p>\n\n<p>I contend that it is atypical for teachers to accept lower compensation for a more challenging job. I would further suggest that even if there were a sufficient number of teachers to staff all urban schools with those that would accept lower compensation for a position in those schools, the gap in compensation that they would accept is low.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are large gaps in non-pecuniary compensation between high performing school and low performing schools that is difficult to overcome.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let us supposed that it&rsquo;s true there are large parts of the teacher workforce that would accept lower compensation (wage and non-wage) to teach in urban schools. There are real benefits to taking on a role where the potential for impact is great.</p>\n\n<p>However, we can consider this benefit as part of the <em>hedonic wages</em> supplied by a teaching role. Other forms of non-monetary compensation that teachers may experience include: a comfortable physical work environment with sufficient space, lighting, and climate control; sufficient supplies to teach effectively; support and acceptance of their students, their families, and the broader school communities; a safe work environment; job security; alignment to a strong, unified school culture; and strong self-efficacy.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these features <em>could</em> be easily replicated in many low performing schools. It is possible to have better quality physical schools and sufficient funding for supplies. Other features can be replicated, but not nearly as easily. Low performing schools where students have complex challenges inside and outside of the classroom are not environments where everyone has a strong sense of self-efficacy.

				"content_text": "\nThere are some basic facts about the teacher labor market that are *inconvenient* for many folks working to improve education. I am going to go through a few premises that I think should be broadly accepted and several lemma and contentions that I hope clarifies my own view on education resources and human capital management.\n\n**Teaching in low performing schools is challenging.**\n\nIf I am looking for a job, all else being equal, I will generally not choose the more challenging one. \n\nSome may object to the idea that teachers would not accept a position that offers a greater opportunity to make a difference, for example, teaching at an inner city school, over one that was less likely to have an impact, like teaching in a posh, suburban neighborhood. It is certainly true that some teachers, if not most teachers place value on making a greater impact. However, the question is how great is that preference? How much less compensation (not just wage) would the median teacher be willing to take to work in a more challenging environment? \n\nI contend that it is atypical for teachers to accept lower compensation for a more challenging job. I would further suggest that even if there were a sufficient number of teachers to staff all urban schools with those that would accept lower compensation for a position in those schools, the gap in compensation that they would accept is low.\n\n**There are large gaps in non-pecuniary compensation between high performing school and low performing schools that is difficult to overcome.**\n\nLet us supposed that it's true there are large parts of the teacher workforce that would accept lower compensation (wage and non-wage) to teach in urban schools. There are real benefits to taking on a role where the potential for impact is great.\n\nHowever, we can consider this benefit as part of the *hedonic wages* supplied by a teaching role. Other forms of non-monetary compensation that teachers may experience include: a comfortable physical work environment with sufficient space, lighting, and climate control; sufficient supplies to teach effectively; support and acceptance of their students, their families, and the broader school communities; a safe work environment; job security; alignment to a strong, unified school culture; and strong self-efficacy.\n\nSome of these features *could* be easily replicated in many low performing schools. It is possible to have better quality physical schools and sufficient funding for supplies. Other features can be replicated, but not nearly as easily. Low performing schools where students have complex challenges inside and outside of the classroom are not environments where everyone has a strong sense of self-efficacy. Even the initial sense that making a difference is within reach erodes for many after facing a challenging environment day after day, year after year. A safe environment and a strong school culture are well within reach, but hardly easy and hardly universal. These things should be universal. They require funding, leadership, and broadly successful organizations.\n\nThe key is not that all high performing schools always have these features and no low performing schools can or do have these features. What is important is that many of these features are less often found in low performing, particularly urban schools.\n\nI contend that the typical gap in non-pecuniary compensation between high and low performing schools is large enough to wipe out any negative compensating wage differential that may exist due to a desire for greater impact.\n\n**The primary mechanism to get \"more\" education is increasing the quality or quantity of teaching.**\n\nLet us take the leap of suggesting that teaching is a key part of the production of education. If we want to improve educational equity and address the needs of low performing schools, we need some combination of more and higher quality teaching. This is a key driver of policies like extended learning time (more), smaller class sizes (more), professional development (better), and teacher evaluation and support systems (better). It is what is behind improving teacher preparation programs (better), alternative certification (better), and progressive support programs like RTI (more and better).\n\n",

While I could spend all day talking about data collection processes and automated validation that should assist with maintaining clean data, most researchers face multiple characteristics per student, unsure of which one is accurate.</p>\n\n<p>While it is true that identity is fluid, and sex/gender or race identifications are not inherently stable overtime, it is often necessary to &ldquo;choose&rdquo; a single value for each student when presenting data. The <a href=\"http://www.strategicdataproject.com\">Strategic Data Project</a> does a great job of defining the business rules for these cases in its <a href=\"http://www.gse.harvard.edu/sdp/resources/toolkit.php\">diagnostic toolkits</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If more than one [attribute value is] observed, report the modal [attribute value]. If multiple modes are observed, report the most recent [attribute value] recorded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is their rule for all attributes considered <em>time-invariant</em> for analysis purposes. I think it is a pretty good one.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing this rule turned out to be more complex than it appeared using R, especially with performant code. In fact, it was this business rule that led me to learn how to use the <code>data.table</code> package.</p>\n\n<p>First, I developed a small test set of data to help me make sure my code accurately reflected the expected results based on the business rule:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># Generate test data for modal_attribute().\nmodal_test &lt;- data.frame(sid = c('1000', '1001', '1000', '1000', '1005', \n                                 '1005', rep('1006',4)),\n                         race = c('Black', 'White', 'Black', 'Hispanic',\n                                  'White', 'White', rep('Black',2), \n                                  rep('Hispanic',2)),\n                         year = c(2006, 2006, 2007, 2008,\n                                  2010, 2011, 2007, 2008,\n                                  2010, 2011))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The test data generated by that code looks like this:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>sasid</th>\n<th align=\"center\">race</th>\n<th align=\"center\">year</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Black</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2006</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1001</td>\n<td align=\"center\">White</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2006</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Black</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Hispanic</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2008</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1005</td>\n<td align=\"center\">White</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2010</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1005</td>\n<td align=\"center\">White</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2011</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1006</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Black</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1006</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Black</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2008</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1006</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Hispanic</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2010</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1006</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Hispanic</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2011</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>And the results should be:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>sasid</th>\n<th align=\"center\">race</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1000</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Black</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1001</td>\n<td align=\"center\">White</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1005</td>\n<td align=\"center\">White</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1006</td>\n<td align=\"center\">Hispanic</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>My first attempts at solving this problem using <code>data.table</code> resulted in a pretty complex set of code.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># Calculate the modal attribute using data.table\nmodal_person_attribute_dt &lt;- function(df, attribute){\n  # df: rbind of all person tables from all years\n  # attribute: vector name to calculate the modal value\n  # Calculate the number of instances an attributed is associated with an id\n  dt &lt;- data.table(df, key='sasid')\n  mode &lt;- dt[, rle(as.character(.SD[[attribute]])), by=sasid]\n  setnames(mode, c('sasid', 'counts', as.character(attribute)))\n  setkeyv(mode, c('sasid', 'counts'))\n  # Only include attributes with the maximum values. This is equivalent to the\n  # mode with two records when there is a tie.\n  mode &lt;- mode[,subset(.SD, counts==max(counts)), by=sasid]\n  mode[,counts:=NULL]\n  setnames(mode, c('sasid', attribute))\n  setkeyv(mode, c('sasid',attribute))\n  # Produce the maximum year value associated with each ID-attribute \n  # pairing    \n  setkeyv(dt, c('sasid',attribute))\n  mode &lt;- dt[,list(schoolyear=max(schoolyear)), by=c(&quot;sasid&quot;, attribute)][mode]\n  setkeyv(mode, c('sasid', 'schoolyear'))\n  # Select the last observation for each ID, which is equivalent to the highest\n  # schoolyear value associated with the most frequent attribute.\n  result &lt;- mode[,lapply(.SD, tail, 1), by=sasid]\n  # Remove the schoolyear to clean up the result\n  result &lt;- result[,schoolyear:=NULL]\n  return(as.data.frame(result))\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This approached seemed &ldquo;natural&rdquo; in <code>data.table</code>, although it took me a while to refine and debug since it was my first time using the package <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2012\"><a href=\"#fn:2012\">1</a></sup>. Essentially, I use <code>rle</code>, a nifty function I used in the past for my <a href=\"{filename}/ranked-likert-scale-visualization.md\">Net-Stacked Likert</a> code to count the number of instances of an attribute each student had in their record. I then subset the data to only the max count value for each student and merge these values back to the original data set. Then I order the data by student id and year in order to select only the last observation per student.</p>\n\n<p>I get a quick, accurate answer when I run the test data through this function. Unfortunately, when I ran the same code on approximately 57,000 unique student IDs and 211,000 total records, the results were less inspiring. My Macbook Air&rsquo;s fans spin up to full speed and timings are terrible:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">&gt; system.time(modal_person_attribute(all_years, 'sex'))\n user  system elapsed \n 40.452   0.246  41.346 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Data cleaning tasks like this one are often only run a few times. Once I have the attributes I need for my analysis, I can save them to a new table in a database, CSV, or similar and never run it again. But ideally, I would like to be able to build a document presenting my data completely from the raw delivered data, including all cleaning steps, accurately. So while I may use a cached, clean data set for some the more sophisticated analysis while I am building up a report, in the final stages I begin running the entire analyses process, including data cleaning, each time I produce the report.</p>\n\n<p>With the release of <code>dplyr</code>, I wanted to reexamine this particular function because it is one of the slowest steps in my analysis. I thought with fresh eyes and a new way of expressing R code, I may be able to improve on the original function. Even if its performance ended up being fairly similar, I hoped the <code>dplyr</code> code would be easier to maintain since I frequently use <code>dplyr</code> and only turn to <code>data.table</code> in specific, sticky situations where performance matters.</p>\n\n<p>In about a tenth the time it took to develop the original code, I came up with this new function:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">modal_person_attribute &lt;- function(x, sid, attribute, year){\n  grouping &lt;- lapply(list(sid, attribute), as.symbol)\n  original &lt;- x\n  max_attributes &lt;- x %.% \n                    regroup(grouping) %.%\n                    summarize(count = n()) %.%\n                    filter(count == max(count))\n  recent_max &lt;- left_join(original, max_attributes) %.%\n                regroup(list(grouping[[1]])) %.%\n                filter(!is.na(count) &amp; count == max(count))\n  results &lt;- recent_max %.% \n             regroup(list(grouping[[1]])) %.%\n             filter(year == max(year))\n  return(results[,c(sid, attribute)])\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At least to my eyes, this code is far more expressive and elegant. First, I generate a <code>data.frame</code> with only the rows that have the most common attribute per student by grouping on student and attribute, counting the size of those groups, and filtering to most common group per student. Then, I do join on the original data and remove any records without a count from the previous step, finding the maximum count per student ID. This recovers the year value for each of the students so that in the next step I can just choose the rows with the highest year.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few funky things (note the use of regroup and grouping, which are related to <code>dplyr</code>&rsquo;s poor handling of strings as arguments), but for the most part I have shorter, clearer code that closely resembles the plain-English stated business rule.</p>\n\n<p>But was this code more performant? Imagine my glee when this happened:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">&gt; system.time(modal_person_attribute_dplyr(all_years, sid='sasid', \n&gt; attribute='sex', year='schoolyear'))\nJoining by: c(&quot;sasid&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;)\n   user  system elapsed \n  1.657   0.087   1.852 \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is a remarkable increase in performance!</p>\n\n<p>Now, I realize that I may have cheated. My <code>data.table</code> code isn&rsquo;t very good and could probably follow a pattern closer to what I did in <code>dplyr</code>. The results might be much closer in the hands of a more adept developer. But the take home message for me was that <code>dplyr</code> enabled me to write the more performant code naturally because of its expressiveness. Not only is my code faster and easier to understand, it is also simpler and took far less time to write.</p>\n\n<p>It is not every day that a tool provides powerful <strong>expressiveness</strong> and yields greater <strong>performance</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"update\">Update</h3>\n\n<p>I have made some improvements to this function to simplify things. I will be maintaining this code in my <a href=\"https://github.com/jasonpbecker/PPSDCollegeReadiness/blob/master/R/modal_person_attribute.R\">PPSDCollegeReadiness repository</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">modal_person_attribute &lt;- function(x, sid, attribute, year){\n  # Select only the important columns\n  x &lt;- x[,c(sid, attribute, year)]\n  names(x) &lt;- c('sid', 'attribute', 'year')\n  # Clean up years\n  if(TRUE %in% grepl('_', x$year)){\n    x$year &lt;- gsub(pattern='[0-9]{4}_([0-9]{4})', '\\\\1', x$year)\n  }  \n  # Calculate the count for each person-attribute combo and select max\n  max_attributes &lt;- x %.% \n                    group_by(sid, attribute) %.%\n                    summarize(count = n()) %.%\n                    filter(count == max(count)) %.%\n                    select(sid, attribute)\n  # Find the max year for each person-attribute combo\n  results &lt;- max_attributes %.% \n             left_join(x) %.%\n             group_by(sid) %.%\n             filter(year == max(year)) %.%\n             select(sid, attribute)\n  names(results) &lt;- c(sid, attribute)\n  return(results)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:2012\">It was over a year ago that I first wrote this code.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:2012\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

In fact, it was this business rule that led me to learn how to use the `data.table` package.\n\nFirst, I developed a small test set of data to help me make sure my code accurately reflected the expected results based on the business rule:\n\n```r\n# Generate test data for modal_attribute().\nmodal_test <- data.frame(sid = c('1000', '1001', '1000', '1000', '1005', \n                                 '1005', rep('1006',4)),\n                         race = c('Black', 'White', 'Black', 'Hispanic',\n                                  'White', 'White', rep('Black',2), \n                                  rep('Hispanic',2)),\n                         year = c(2006, 2006, 2007, 2008,\n                                  2010, 2011, 2007, 2008,\n                                  2010, 2011))\n```\n\nThe test data generated by that code looks like this:\n    \n| sasid |   race   | year |\n| ----- | :------: | :--: |\n|  1000 |  Black   | 2006 |\n|  1001 |  White   | 2006 |\n|  1000 |  Black   | 2007 |\n|  1000 | Hispanic | 2008 |\n|  1005 |  White   | 2010 |\n|  1005 |  White   | 2011 |\n|  1006 |  Black   | 2007 |\n|  1006 |  Black   | 2008 |\n|  1006 | Hispanic | 2010 |\n|  1006 | Hispanic | 2011 |\n\nAnd the results should be:\n\n| sasid | race     |\n| ----- | :------: |\n| 1000  | Black    |\n| 1001  | White    |\n| 1005  | White    |\n| 1006  | Hispanic |\n\nMy first attempts at solving this problem using `data.table` resulted in a pretty complex set of code.\n\n```r\n# Calculate the modal attribute using data.table\nmodal_person_attribute_dt <- function(df, attribute){\n  # df: rbind of all person tables from all years\n  # attribute: vector name to calculate the modal value\n  # Calculate the number of instances an attributed is associated with an id\n  dt <- data.table(df, key='sasid')\n  mode <- dt[, rle(as.character(.SD[[attribute]])), by=sasid]\n  setnames(mode, c('sasid', 'counts', as.character(attribute)))\n  setkeyv(mode, c('sasid', 'counts'))\n  # Only include attributes with the maximum values. This is equivalent to the\n  # mode with two records when there is a tie.\n  mode <- mode[,subset(.SD, counts==max(counts)), by=sasid]\n  mode[,counts:=NULL]\n  setnames(mode, c('sasid', attribute))\n  setkeyv(mode, c('sasid',attribute))\n  # Produce the maximum year value associated with each ID-attribute \n  # pairing    \n  setkeyv(dt, c('sasid',attribute))\n  mode <- dt[,list(schoolyear=max(schoolyear)), by=c(\"sasid\", attribute)][mode]\n  setkeyv(mode, c('sasid', 'schoolyear'))\n  # Select the last observation for each ID, which is equivalent to the highest\n  # schoolyear value associated with the most frequent attribute.\n  result <- mode[,lapply(.SD, tail, 1), by=sasid]\n  # Remove the schoolyear to clean up the result\n  result <- result[,schoolyear:=NULL]\n  return(as.data.frame(result))\n}\n```\n\nThis approached seemed \"natural\" in `data.table`, although it took me a while to refine and debug since it was my first time using the package [^2012]. Essentially, I use `rle`, a nifty function I used in the past for my [Net-Stacked Likert]({filename}/ranked-likert-scale-visualization.md) code to count the number of instances of an attribute each student had in their record. I then subset the data to only the max count value for each student and merge these values back to the original data set. Then I order the data by student id and year in order to select only the last observation per student.\n\nI get a quick, accurate answer when I run the test data through this function. Unfortunately, when I ran the same code on approximately 57,000 unique student IDs and 211,000 total records, the results were less inspiring. My Macbook Air's fans spin up to full speed and timings are terrible:\n\n```r\n> system.time(modal_person_attribute(all_years, 'sex'))\n user  system elapsed \n 40.452   0.246  41.346 \n```\n\nData cleaning tasks like this one are often only run a few times. Once I have the attributes I need for my analysis, I can save them to a new table in a database, CSV, or similar and never run it again. But ideally, I would like to be able to build a document presenting my data completely from the raw delivered data, including all cleaning steps, accurately. So while I may use a cached, clean data set for some the more sophisticated analysis while I am building up a report, in the final stages I begin running the entire analyses process, including data cleaning, each time I produce the report.\n\nWith the release of `dplyr`, I wanted to reexamine this particular function because it is one of the slowest steps in my analysis. I thought with fresh eyes and a new way of expressing R code, I may be able to improve on the original function. Even if its performance ended up being fairly similar, I hoped the `dplyr` code would be easier to maintain since I frequently use `dplyr` and only turn to `data.table` in specific, sticky situations where performance matters.\n\nIn about a tenth the time it took to develop the original code, I came up with this new function:\n\n```r\nmodal_person_attribute <- function(x, sid, attribute, year){\n  grouping <- lapply(list(sid, attribute), as.symbol)\n  original <- x\n  max_attributes <- x %.% \n                    regroup(grouping) %.%\n                    summarize(count = n()) %.%\n                    filter(count == max(count))\n  recent_max <- left_join(original, max_attributes) %.%\n                regroup(list(grouping[[1]])) %.%\n                filter(!is.na(count) & count == max(count))\n  results <- recent_max %.% \n             regroup(list(grouping[[1]])) %.%\n             filter(year == max(year))\n  return(results[,c(sid, attribute)])\n}\n```\n\nAt least to my eyes, this code is far more expressive and elegant. First, I generate a `data.frame` with only the rows that have the most common attribute per student by grouping on student and attribute, counting the size of those groups, and filtering to most common group per student. Then, I do join on the original data and remove any records without a count from the previous step, finding the maximum count per student ID. This recovers the year value for each of the students so that in the next step I can just choose the rows with the highest year.\n\nThere are a few funky things (note the use of regroup and grouping, which are related to `dplyr`'s poor handling of strings as arguments), but for the most part I have shorter, clearer code that closely resembles the plain-English stated business rule.\n\nBut was this code more performant? Imagine my glee when this happened:\n\n```r\n> system.time(modal_person_attribute_dplyr(all_years, sid='sasid', \n> attribute='sex', year='schoolyear'))\nJoining by: c(\"sasid\", \"sex\")\n   user  system elapsed \n  1.657   0.087   1.852 \n```\n\nThat is a remarkable increase in performance!\n\nNow, I realize that I may have cheated. My `data.table` code isn't very good and could probably follow a pattern closer to what I did in `dplyr`. The results might be much closer in the hands of a more adept developer. But the take home message for me was that `dplyr` enabled me to write the more performant code naturally because of its expressiveness. Not only is my code faster and easier to understand, it is also simpler and took far less time to write.\n\nIt is not every day that a tool provides powerful **expressiveness** and yields greater **performance**.\n\n### Update\n\nI have made some improvements to this function to simplify things. I will be maintaining this code in my [PPSDCollegeReadiness repository](https://github.com/jasonpbecker/PPSDCollegeReadiness/blob/master/R/modal_person_attribute.R).\n\n```r\nmodal_person_attribute <- function(x, sid, attribute, year){\n  # Select only the important columns\n  x <- x[,c(sid, attribute, year)]\n  names(x) <- c('sid', 'attribute', 'year')\n  # Clean up years\n  if(TRUE %in% grepl('_', x$year)){\n    x$year <- gsub(pattern='[0-9]{4}_([0-9]{4})', '\\\\1', x$year)\n  }  \n  # Calculate the count for each person-attribute combo and select max\n  max_attributes <- x %.% \n                    group_by(sid, attribute) %.%\n                    summarize(count = n()) %.%\n                    filter(count == max(count)) %.%\n                    select(sid, attribute)\n  # Find the max year for each person-attribute combo\n  results <- max_attributes %.% \n             left_join(x) %.%\n             group_by(sid) %.%\n             filter(year == max(year)) %.%\n             select(sid, attribute)\n  names(results) <- c(sid, attribute)\n  return(results)\n}\n```\n\n\n[^2012]: It was over a year ago that I first wrote this code.\n",

Investing in smaller garages by footprint that have to be built taller and provide no change in capacity probably make no sense at all. If we&rsquo;re going to build any kind of public garage at all, it should be with the goal of consolidating parking into infrastructure with reasonable land utilization. We would rather 3 or 4 large garages properly located than all of the current lots. Limiting their size because of the flexibility available due to reducing on-street parking or the footprint on existing lots doesn&rsquo;t achieve that and doesn&rsquo;t factor in orders-of-magnitude changes in capacity we should need for all transit modes in the next 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>On point three, I am skeptical. I like the idea of improving bus infrastructure when building parking infrastructure in general. In fact, I voted against the \\$40M Providence road paving bond even though that was much needed maintenance. My rationale was purely ideological&ndash; we should not use debt to pay for car maintenance without also investing in ways to reduce future maintenance costs through better utilization of those roads. However, I have a hard time believing that the Garrahy location is any good as a bus hub. If RIPTA did a great job identifying the need for an additional bus hub that the Garrahy location met the criteria for, I think it&rsquo;s a reasonable idea.

I think an appropriate level is probably not that different from the recently erected Johnson and Wales garage. The reality is that street-level retail is the right form, but there isn&rsquo;t sufficient foot traffic to support it right now and won&rsquo;t be for some time.

Not a dime should be spent on a public parking spot that is closed at any point in time, anywhere in the city. I would actually ditto this for surface parking lots on commercial properties of any kind after business hours. Not only should they have to be open, they should have to provide signs indicating the hours of commercial activity when parking is restricted and the hours when parking is available to the public.

The problem is that deep disparities we see when these students enter schooling point to having less prior knowledge than their peers [^culturalliteracy].\n\n[^culturalliteracy]: This has pretty much been the thrust behind E.D. Hirsch's work, who has been accused of being on the far right in education, despite his consistent belief that education equity is one of the most important goals to achieve. His firm belief, and I am mostly convinced, is that explicit factual content is the key tool for how teaching can dramatically improve educational equity.\n\nWhat is remarkable, and tragic, is that the \"Skills\" camp has maintained its dominance through the demonization of \"Facts\", with dramatic misinterpretations like:\n\n  1. The \"Facts\" folks are just White colonialists seeking to maintain existing power structures through teaching the information of privilege.\n  2. The \"Facts\" folks privilege memorization, rote learning, and recall-based assessment over other pedagogy that is more engaging and authentic.\n  3. The \"Facts\" folks can only ever teach what was important yesterday; \"Skills\" camp can teach what matters to become a lifelong learner for tomorrow's world.\n\nNone of these are true.\n\n*This post is largely brought to you by: E.D. Hirsch, Dan T. Willingham, and Malcolm Gladwell via Merlin Mann.*\n",

I could talk about the tone of the instrument or about quality of the performance or any number of other things.

When I play music for other people, it actually sounds different than when I experience it for myself. Little complexities that seem crucial to the mix seem to cower and hide rather than loom large in the presence of others. It is not really feasible to point out what makes the song so great while listening, because it disrupts the experience.

Back then, it seemed trivial to find a new artist or album to obsess over.\n\nDespite being steeped in music, I have always found it hard to write about. The truth is, I have limited ability to use words to explain just what makes a particular piece of music so wonderful. Oh sure, I could discuss structure, point out a particular hook in a particular section and how it sits in the mix. I could talk about the tone of the instrument or about quality of the performance or any number of other things. The problem with this language is it reduces what is great about *this* piece of music to a description that could easily fit some other piece of music. Verbalizing the experience of music projects a woefully flattened artifact of something breathtaking.\n\nNow it might seem that recorded music has greatly diminished this challenge. After all, the experience of recorded music can scale-- anyone can listen. Unfortunately, I found this to be completely untrue. When I play music for other people, it actually sounds different than when I experience it for myself. Little complexities that seem crucial to the mix seem to cower and hide rather than loom large in the presence of others. It is not really feasible to point out what makes the song so great while listening, because it disrupts the experience. Worst of all, no one else seems to experience what I experience when I listen.\n\nOf course, all of this may seem obvious to someone who has read about aesthetics. I have not.\n\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>In a couple of previous posts, I outlined the importance of <a href=\"filename|documentation-of-business-rules-and-analysis.md\">documenting business rules for common education statistics</a> and described my take on how to <a href=\"new-calculation-for-student-mobility.md\">best calculate student mobility</a>. In this post, I will be sharing two versions of R function I wrote to implement this mobility calculation, reviewing their different structure and methods to reveal how I achieved an order of magnitude speed up between the two versions. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:optimization\"><a href=\"#fn:optimization\">1</a></sup> At the end of this post, I will propose several future routes for optimization that I believe should lead to the ability to handle millions of student records in seconds.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"version-0-where-do-i-begin\">Version 0: Where Do I Begin?</h2>\n\n<p>The first thing I tend to do is whiteboard the rules I want to use through careful consideration and constant referal back to real data sets. By staying grounded in the data, I am less likely to encounter unexpected situations during my quality control. It also makes it much easier to develop test data, since I seek out outlier records in actual data during the business rule process.</p>\n\n<p>Developing test data is a key part of the development process. Without a compact, but sufficiently complex, set of data to try with a newly developed function, there is no way to know whether or not it does what I intend.</p>\n\n<p>Recall the <a href=\"filename|new-calculation-for-student-mobility.md\">business rules for mobility</a> that I have proposed, all of which came out of this whiteboarding process:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Entering the data with an enroll date after the start of the year counts as one move.</li>\n<li>Leaving the data with an exit date before the end of the year counts as one move.</li>\n<li>Changing schools sometime during the year without a large gap in enrollment counts as one move.</li>\n<li>Changing schools sometime during the year with a large gap in enrollment counts as two moves.</li>\n<li>Adjacent enrollment records for the same student in the same school without a large gap in enrollment does not count as moving.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Test data needs to represent each of these situations so that I can confirm the function is properly implementing each rule.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a copy of my test data. As an exercise, I recommend determining the number of &ldquo;moves&rdquo; each of these students should be credited with after applying the above stated business rules.</p>\n\n<p>| Unique Student ID   | School Code   | Enrollment Date   | Exit Date    |  |\n| &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- | &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- | &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash; | &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; |  |\n| 1000000             | 10101         | 2012-10-15        | 2012-11-15   |  |\n| 1000000             | 10103         | 2012-01-03        | 2013-03-13   |  |\n| 1000000             | 10103         | 2012-03-20        | 2013-05-13   |  |\n| 1000001             | 10101         | 2012-09-01        | 2013-06-15   |  |\n| 1000002             | 10102         | 2012-09-01        | 2013-01-23   |  |\n| 1000003             | 10102         | 2012-09-15        | 2012-11-15   |  |\n| 1000003             | 10102         | 2013-03-15        | 2013-06-15   |  |\n| 1000004             | 10103         | 2013-03-15        | NA           |  |</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"version-1-a-naïve-implementation\">Version 1: A Naïve Implementation</h2>\n\n<p>Once I have developed business rules and a test data set, I like to quickly confirm that I can produce the desired results. That&rsquo;s particularly true when it comes to implementing a new, fairly complex business rules. My initial implementation of a new algorithm does not need to be efficient, easily understood, or maintainable. My goal is simply to follow my initial hunch on how to accomplish a task and get it working. Sometimes this <em>naïve implementation</em> turns out to be pretty close to my final implementation, but sometimes it can be quite far off. The main things I tend to improve with additional work are extensibility, readability, and performance.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of this mobility calculation, I knew almost immediately that my initial approach was not going to have good performance characteristics. Here is a step by step discussion of Version 1.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"function-declaration-parameters\">Function Declaration: Parameters</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">moves_calc &lt;- function(df, \n                       enrollby,\n                       exitby,\n                       gap=14,\n                       sid='sid', \n                       schid='schid',\n                       enroll_date='enroll_date',\n                       exit_date='exit_date')){\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I named my function <code>moves_calc()</code> to match the style of <code>age_calc()</code> which was submitted and accepted to the eeptools package. This new function has eight parameters.</p>\n\n<p><code>df</code>: a <code>data.frame</code> containing the required data to do the mobility calculation.</p>\n\n<p><code>enrollby</code>: an atomic vector of type <code>character</code> or <code>Date</code> in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. This parameter signifies the start of the school year. Students whose first enrollment is after this date will have an additional  <code>move</code> under the assumption that they enrolled somewhere prior to the first enrollment record in the data. This does not (and likely should not) match the actual first day of the school year.</p>\n\n<p><code>exitby</code>: an atomic vector of type <code>character</code> or <code>Date</code> in the format  <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. This parameter signifies the end of the school year. Students whose last exit is before this date will have an additional <code>move</code> under the assumption that they enrolled somewhere after this exit record that is excluded in the data. This date does not (and likely should not) match the actual last day of the school year.</p>\n\n<p><code>gap</code>: an atomic vector of type <code>numeric</code> that signifies how long a gap must exist between student records to record an additional move for that student under the assumption that they enrolled somewhere in between the two records in the data that is not recorded.</p>\n\n<p><code>sid</code>: an atomic vector of type <code>character</code> that represents the name of the vector in <code>df</code> that contains the unique student identifier. The default value is <code>'sid'</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>schid</code>: an atomic vector of type <code>character</code> that represents the name of the vector in <code>df</code> that contains the unique school identifier. The default value is <code>schid</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>enroll_date</code>: an atomic vector of type <code>character</code> that represents the name of the vector in <code>df</code> that contains the enrollment date for each record. The default value is <code>enroll_date</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>exit_date</code>: an atomic vector of type <code>character</code> that represents the name of the vector in <code>df</code> that contains the exit date for each record. The default value is <code>exit_date</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these parameters are about providing flexibility around the naming of attributes in the data set. Although I often write functions for my own work which accept <code>data.frames</code>, I can not help but to feel this is a bad practice. Assuming particular data attributes of the right name and type does not make for generalizable code. To make up for my shortcoming in this area, I have done my best to allow other users to enter whatever data column names they want, so long as they contain the right information to run the algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>The next portion of the function loads some of the required packages and is common to many of my custom functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">if(&quot;data.table&quot; %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE){\n    install.packages(&quot;data.table&quot;)\n  } \nrequire(data.table)\n\nif(&quot;plyr&quot; %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE){\n    install.packages(&quot;plyr&quot;)\n  } \nrequire(plyr)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"type-checking-and-programmatic-defaults\">Type Checking and Programmatic Defaults</h3>\n\n<p>Next, I do extensive type-checking to make sure that <code>df</code> is structured the way I expect it to be in order to run the algorithm. I do my best to supply humane <code>warning()</code> and <code>stop()</code> messages when things go wrong, and in some cases, set default values that may help the function run even if function is not called properly.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">if (!inherits(df[[enroll_date]], &quot;Date&quot;) | !inherits(df[[exit_date]], &quot;Date&quot;))\n    stop(&quot;Both enroll_date and exit_date must be Date objects&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>enroll_date</code> and <code>exit_date</code> both have to be <code>Date</code> objects. I could have attempted to coerce those vectors into <code>Date</code> types using <code>as.Date()</code>, but I would rather not assume something like the date format. Since <code>enroll_date</code> and <code>exit_date</code> are the most critical attributes of each student, the function will <code>stop()</code> if they are the incorrect type, informing the analyst to clean up the data.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">if(missing(enrollby)){\n   enrollby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(min(df$enroll_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                              '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n}else{\n  if(is.na(as.Date(enrollby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;))){\n     enrollby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(min(df$enroll_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                               '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d'\n     warning(paste(&quot;enrollby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,&quot;,\n                   &quot;defaulting to&quot;, \n                   enrollby, sep=' '))\n  }else{\n    enrollby &lt;- as.Date(enrollby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)\n  }\n}\nif(missing(exitby)){\n  exitby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(max(df$exit_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                          '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n}else{\n  if(is.na(as.Date(exitby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;))){\n    exitby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(max(df$exit_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                              '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n    warning(paste(&quot;exitby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,&quot;,\n                  &quot;defaulting to&quot;, \n                  exitby, sep=' '))\n  }else{\n    exitby &lt;- as.Date(exitby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)\n  }\n}\nif(!is.numeric(gap)){\n  gap &lt;- 14\n  warning(&quot;gap was not a number, defaulting to 14 days&quot;)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For maximum flexibility, I have parameterized the <code>enrollby</code>, <code>exitby</code>, and <code>gap</code> used by the algorithm to determine student moves. An astute observer of the function declaration may have noticed I did not set default values for <code>enrollby</code> or <code>exitby</code>. This is because these dates are naturally going to be different which each year of data. As a result, I want to enforce their explicit declaration.</p>\n\n<p>However, we all make mistakes. So when I check to see if <code>enrollby</code> or <code>exitby</code> are <code>missing()</code>, I do not stop the function if it returns <code>TRUE</code>. Instead, I set the value <code>enrollby</code> to September 15 in the year that matches the minimum (first) enrollment record and <code>exitby</code> to June 1 in the year that matches the maximum (last) exit record. I then pop off a <code>warning()</code> that informs the user the expected values for each parameter and what values I have defaulted them to. I chose to use <code>warning()</code> because many R users set their environment to halt at <code>warnings()</code>. They are generally not good and should be pursued and fixed. No one should depend upon the defaulting process I use in the function. But the defaults that can be determined programmatically are sensible enough that I did not feel the need to always halt the function in its place.</p>\n\n<p>I also check to see if <code>gap</code> is, in fact, defined as a number. If not, I also throw a <code>warning()</code> after setting <code>gap</code> equal to default value of <code>14</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Is this all of the type and error-checking I could have included? Probably not, but I think this represents a very sensible set that make this function much more generalizable outside of my coding environment. This kind of checking may be overkill for a project that is worked on independently and with a single data set, but colleagues, including your future self, will likely be thankful for their inclusion if any of your code is to be reused.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"initializing-the-results\">Initializing the Results</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">output &lt;- data.frame(id = as.character(unique(df[[sid]])),\n                     moves = vector(mode = 'numeric', \n                                    length = length(unique(df[[sid]]))))\noutput &lt;- data.table(output, key='id')\ndf &lt;- arrange(df, sid, enroll_date)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My naïve implementation uses a lot of <code>for</code> loops, a no-no when it comes to R performance. One way to make <code>for</code> loops a lot worse, and this is true in any language, is to reassign a variable within the loop. This means that each iteration has the overhead of creating and assigning that object. Especially when we are building up results for each observation, it is silly to do this. We know exactly how big the data will be and therefore only need to create the object once. We can then assign a much smaller part of that object (in this case, one value in a vector) rather than the whole object (a honking <code>data.table</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Our <code>output</code> object is what the function returns. It is a simple <code>data.table</code> containing all of the unique student identifiers and the number of <code>moves</code> recorded for each student.</p>\n\n<p>The last line in this code chunk ensures that the data are arranged by the unique student identifier and enrollment date. This is key since the <code>for</code> loops assume that they are traversing a student&rsquo;s record sequentially.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-rule-1-the-latecomer\">Business Rule 1: The Latecomer</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">for(i in 1:(length(df[[sid]])-1)){\n  if(i&gt;1 &amp;&amp; df[sid][i,]!=df[sid][(i-1),]){\n    if(df[['enroll_date']][i]&gt;enrollby){\n      output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L]\n    }\n  }else if(i==1){\n    if(df[['enroll_date']][i]&gt;enrollby){\n    output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L]\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first bit of logic checks if <code>sid</code> in row <code>i</code> is not equal to the <code>sid</code> in the <code>i-1</code> row. In other words, is this the first time we are observing this student? If it is, then row <code>i</code> is the first observation for that student and therefore has the minimum enrollment date. The <code>enroll_date</code> is checked against <code>enrollby</code>. When <code>enroll_date</code> is after <code>enrollby</code>, then the <code>moves</code> attribute for that <code>sid</code> is incremented by 1. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:increments\"><a href=\"#fn:increments\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t really mention the conditional that <code>i&gt;1</code>. This is needed because there is no <code>i-1</code> observation for the very first row of the <code>data.table</code>. Therefore, <code>i==1</code> is a special case where we once again perform the same check for <code>enroll_date</code> and <code>enrollby</code>. The <code>i&gt;1</code> condition is before the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator, which ensures the statement after the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> is not evaluated when the first conditional is <code>FALSE</code>. This avoids an &ldquo;out of bounds&rdquo;-type error where R tries to check <code>df[0]</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-rule-5-the-feint\">Business Rule 5: The Feint</h3>\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah&ndash; the business rule list above doesn&rsquo;t match the order of my function. That&rsquo;s ok. Remember, sometimes giving instructions to a computer does not follow the way you would organize instructions for humans.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the function is traversing through our <code>data.frame</code> one row at a time. First I checked to see if the function is at the first record for a particular student. Now I check to see if there are any records after the current record.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">  if(df[sid][i,]==df[sid][(i+1),]){\n    if(as.numeric(difftime(df[['enroll_date']][i+1], \n                           df[['exit_date']][i], units='days')) &lt; gap &amp;\n       df[schid][(i+1),]==df[schid][i,]){\n        next\n    }else if ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the case where the <code>i+1</code> record has the same <code>sid</code>, then the <code>enroll_date</code> of <code>i+1</code> is subtracted from the <code>exit_date</code> of <code>i</code> and checked against <code>gap</code>. If it is both less than <code>gap</code> and the <code>schid</code> of <code>i+1</code> is the same as <code>i</code>, then <code>next</code>, which basically breaks out of this conditional and moves on without altering moves. In other words, students who are in the same school with only a few days between the time they exited are not counting has having moved.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>...</code> above is not the special <code>...</code> in R, rather, I&rsquo;m continuing that line below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-rule-3-the-smooth-mover\">Business Rule 3: The Smooth Mover</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">  }else if(as.numeric(difftime(df[['enroll_date']][i+1], \n                               df[['exit_date']][i], \n                               units='days')) &lt; gap){\n    output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L] \n  }else{ ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we have the simple case where a student has moved to another school (recall, this is still within the <code>if</code> conditional where the next record is the same student as the current record) with a very short period of time between the <code>exit_date</code> at the current record and the <code>enroll_date</code> of the next record. This is considered a &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; move from one school to another, and therefore that student&rsquo;s moves are incremented by 1.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-rule-4-the-long-hop\">Business Rule 4: The Long Hop</h3>\n\n<p>Our final scenario for a student moving between schools is when the gap between the <code>exit_date</code> at the <code>i</code> school and the <code>enroll_date</code> at the <code>i+1</code> school is large, defined as <code>&gt; gap</code>. In this scenario, the assumption is that the student moved to a jurisdiction outside of the data set, such as out of district for district-level data or out of state for state level data, and enrolled in at least one school not present in their enrollment record. The result is these students receive <code>2 moves</code>&ndash; one out from the <code>i</code> school to a missing school and one in to the <code>i+1</code> school from the missing school.</p>\n\n<p>The code looks like this (again a repeat from the <code>else{...</code> above which was not using the <code>...</code> character):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">  }else{\n    output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+2L] \n  }\n}else...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This ends with a <code>}</code> which closes the <code>if</code> conditional that checked if the <code>i+1</code> student was the same as the <code>i</code> student, leaving only one more business rule to check.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-rule-2-the-early-summer\">Business Rule 2: The Early Summer</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">}else{\n  if(is.na(df[['exit_date']][i])){\n    next\n  }else if(df[['exit_date']][i] &lt; exitby){\n        output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Recall that this <code>else</code> block is only called if <code>sid</code> of the <code>i+1</code> record is not the same as <code>i</code>. This means that this is the final entry for a particular student. First, I check to see if that student has a missing <code>exit_date</code> and if so charges no <code>move</code> to the student implementing the <code>next</code> statement to break out of this iteration of the loop. Students never have missing <code>enroll_date</code> for any of the data I have seen over 8 years. This is because most systems minimally autogenerate the <code>enroll_date</code> for the current date when a student first enters a student information system. However, sometimes districts forget to properly exit a student and are unable to supply an accurate <code>exit_date</code>. In a very small number of cases I have seen these missing dates. So I do not want the function to fail in this scenario. My solution here was simply to break out and move to the next iteration of the loop.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I apply the last rule, which compares the final <code>exit_date</code> for a student to <code>exitby</code>, incrementing <code>moves</code> if the student left prior to the end of the year and likely enrolled elsewhere before the summer.</p>\n\n<p>The last step is to close the <code>for</code> loop and <code>return</code> our result:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">  }\n  return(output)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"version-2-10x-speed-and-more-readable\">Version 2: 10x Speed And More Readable</h2>\n\n<p>The second version of this code is vastly quicker.</p>\n\n<p>The opening portion of the code, including the error checking is essentially a repeat of before, as is the initialization of the output.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">moves_calc &lt;- function(df, \n                       enrollby,\n                       exitby,\n                       gap=14,\n                       sid='sasid', \n                       schid='schno',\n                       enroll_date='enroll_date',\n                       exit_date='exit_date'){\n  if(&quot;data.table&quot; %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE){\n    install.packages(&quot;data.table&quot;)\n  } \n  require(data.table)\n  if (!inherits(df[[enroll_date]], &quot;Date&quot;) | !inherits(df[[exit_date]], &quot;Date&quot;))\n      stop(&quot;Both enroll_date and exit_date must be Date objects&quot;)\n  if(missing(enrollby)){\n    enrollby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(min(df[[enroll_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                              '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n  }else{\n    if(is.na(as.Date(enrollby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;))){\n      enrollby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(min(df[[enroll_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                                '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n      warning(paste(&quot;enrollby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,&quot;,\n                    &quot;defaulting to&quot;, \n                    enrollby, sep=' '))\n    }else{\n      enrollby &lt;- as.Date(enrollby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)\n    }\n  }\n  if(missing(exitby)){\n    exitby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(max(df[[exit_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                            '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n  }else{\n    if(is.na(as.Date(exitby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;))){\n      exitby &lt;- as.Date(paste(year(max(df[[exit_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                                '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n      warning(paste(&quot;exitby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,&quot;,\n                    &quot;defaulting to&quot;, \n                    exitby, sep=' '))\n    }else{\n      exitby &lt;- as.Date(exitby, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)\n    }\n  }\n  if(!is.numeric(gap)){\n    gap &lt;- 14\n    warning(&quot;gap was not a number, defaulting to 14 days&quot;)\n  }\n  output &lt;- data.frame(id = as.character(unique(df[[sid]])),\n                       moves = vector(mode = 'numeric', \n                                      length = length(unique(df[[sid]]))))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where things start to get interesting is in the calculation of the number of student moves.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"handling-missing-data\">Handling Missing Data</h3>\n\n<p>One of the clever bits of code I forgot about when I initially tried to refactor Version 1 appears under &ldquo;Business Rule 2: The Early Summer&rdquo;.

I created a new function inside of this function that can count how many moves are associated with a set of enrollment records, ignoring the considerations in Business Rules 1 and 2.

				"content_text": "\nIn a couple of previous posts, I outlined the importance of [documenting business rules for common education statistics](filename|documentation-of-business-rules-and-analysis.md) and described my take on how to [best calculate student mobility](new-calculation-for-student-mobility.md). In this post, I will be sharing two versions of R function I wrote to implement this mobility calculation, reviewing their different structure and methods to reveal how I achieved an order of magnitude speed up between the two versions. [^optimization] At the end of this post, I will propose several future routes for optimization that I believe should lead to the ability to handle millions of student records in seconds.\n\n## Version 0: Where Do I Begin?\n\nThe first thing I tend to do is whiteboard the rules I want to use through careful consideration and constant referal back to real data sets. By staying grounded in the data, I am less likely to encounter unexpected situations during my quality control. It also makes it much easier to develop test data, since I seek out outlier records in actual data during the business rule process.\n\nDeveloping test data is a key part of the development process. Without a compact, but sufficiently complex, set of data to try with a newly developed function, there is no way to know whether or not it does what I intend.\n\nRecall the [business rules for mobility](filename|new-calculation-for-student-mobility.md) that I have proposed, all of which came out of this whiteboarding process:\n\n1. Entering the data with an enroll date after the start of the year counts as one move.\n2. Leaving the data with an exit date before the end of the year counts as one move.\n3. Changing schools sometime during the year without a large gap in enrollment counts as one move.\n4. Changing schools sometime during the year with a large gap in enrollment counts as two moves.\n5. Adjacent enrollment records for the same student in the same school without a large gap in enrollment does not count as moving.\n\nTest data needs to represent each of these situations so that I can confirm the function is properly implementing each rule.\n\nBelow is a copy of my test data. As an exercise, I recommend determining the number of \"moves\" each of these students should be credited with after applying the above stated business rules.\n\n| Unique Student ID   | School Code   | Enrollment Date   | Exit Date    |  |\n| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |  |\n| 1000000             | 10101         | 2012-10-15        | 2012-11-15   |  |\n| 1000000             | 10103         | 2012-01-03        | 2013-03-13   |  |\n| 1000000             | 10103         | 2012-03-20        | 2013-05-13   |  |\n| 1000001             | 10101         | 2012-09-01        | 2013-06-15   |  |\n| 1000002             | 10102         | 2012-09-01        | 2013-01-23   |  |\n| 1000003             | 10102         | 2012-09-15        | 2012-11-15   |  |\n| 1000003             | 10102         | 2013-03-15        | 2013-06-15   |  |\n| 1000004             | 10103         | 2013-03-15        | NA           |  |\n\n## Version 1: A Naïve Implementation\n\nOnce I have developed business rules and a test data set, I like to quickly confirm that I can produce the desired results. That's particularly true when it comes to implementing a new, fairly complex business rules. My initial implementation of a new algorithm does not need to be efficient, easily understood, or maintainable. My goal is simply to follow my initial hunch on how to accomplish a task and get it working. Sometimes this *naïve implementation* turns out to be pretty close to my final implementation, but sometimes it can be quite far off. The main things I tend to improve with additional work are extensibility, readability, and performance.\n\nIn the case of this mobility calculation, I knew almost immediately that my initial approach was not going to have good performance characteristics. Here is a step by step discussion of Version 1.\n\n### Function Declaration: Parameters\n\n```r\nmoves_calc <- function(df, \n                       enrollby,\n                       exitby,\n                       gap=14,\n                       sid='sid', \n                       schid='schid',\n                       enroll_date='enroll_date',\n                       exit_date='exit_date')){\n```\n\nI named my function `moves_calc()` to match the style of `age_calc()` which was submitted and accepted to the eeptools package. This new function has eight parameters.\n\n\n`df`: a `data.frame` containing the required data to do the mobility calculation. \n \n`enrollby`: an atomic vector of type `character` or `Date` in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. This parameter signifies the start of the school year. Students whose first enrollment is after this date will have an additional  `move` under the assumption that they enrolled somewhere prior to the first enrollment record in the data. This does not (and likely should not) match the actual first day of the school year.\n\n`exitby`: an atomic vector of type `character` or `Date` in the format  `YYYY-MM-DD`. This parameter signifies the end of the school year. Students whose last exit is before this date will have an additional `move` under the assumption that they enrolled somewhere after this exit record that is excluded in the data. This date does not (and likely should not) match the actual last day of the school year.\n \n`gap`: an atomic vector of type `numeric` that signifies how long a gap must exist between student records to record an additional move for that student under the assumption that they enrolled somewhere in between the two records in the data that is not recorded.\n\n`sid`: an atomic vector of type `character` that represents the name of the vector in `df` that contains the unique student identifier. The default value is `'sid'`.\n\n`schid`: an atomic vector of type `character` that represents the name of the vector in `df` that contains the unique school identifier. The default value is `schid`.\n\n`enroll_date`: an atomic vector of type `character` that represents the name of the vector in `df` that contains the enrollment date for each record. The default value is `enroll_date`.\n\n`exit_date`: an atomic vector of type `character` that represents the name of the vector in `df` that contains the exit date for each record. The default value is `exit_date`.\n\nMost of these parameters are about providing flexibility around the naming of attributes in the data set. Although I often write functions for my own work which accept `data.frames`, I can not help but to feel this is a bad practice. Assuming particular data attributes of the right name and type does not make for generalizable code. To make up for my shortcoming in this area, I have done my best to allow other users to enter whatever data column names they want, so long as they contain the right information to run the algorithm.\n\nThe next portion of the function loads some of the required packages and is common to many of my custom functions:\n\n```r\nif(\"data.table\" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE){\n    install.packages(\"data.table\")\n  } \nrequire(data.table)\n\nif(\"plyr\" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE){\n    install.packages(\"plyr\")\n  } \nrequire(plyr)\n```\n### Type Checking and Programmatic Defaults\n\nNext, I do extensive type-checking to make sure that `df` is structured the way I expect it to be in order to run the algorithm. I do my best to supply humane `warning()` and `stop()` messages when things go wrong, and in some cases, set default values that may help the function run even if function is not called properly.\n\n```r\nif (!inherits(df[[enroll_date]], \"Date\") | !inherits(df[[exit_date]], \"Date\"))\n    stop(\"Both enroll_date and exit_date must be Date objects\")\n```\n\nThe `enroll_date` and `exit_date` both have to be `Date` objects. I could have attempted to coerce those vectors into `Date` types using `as.Date()`, but I would rather not assume something like the date format. Since `enroll_date` and `exit_date` are the most critical attributes of each student, the function will `stop()` if they are the incorrect type, informing the analyst to clean up the data.\n\n```r\nif(missing(enrollby)){\n   enrollby <- as.Date(paste(year(min(df$enroll_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                              '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n}else{\n  if(is.na(as.Date(enrollby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\"))){\n     enrollby <- as.Date(paste(year(min(df$enroll_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                               '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d'\n     warning(paste(\"enrollby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,\",\n                   \"defaulting to\", \n                   enrollby, sep=' '))\n  }else{\n    enrollby <- as.Date(enrollby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n  }\n}\nif(missing(exitby)){\n  exitby <- as.Date(paste(year(max(df$exit_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                          '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n}else{\n  if(is.na(as.Date(exitby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\"))){\n    exitby <- as.Date(paste(year(max(df$exit_date, na.rm=TRUE)),\n                              '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n    warning(paste(\"exitby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,\",\n                  \"defaulting to\", \n                  exitby, sep=' '))\n  }else{\n    exitby <- as.Date(exitby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n  }\n}\nif(!is.numeric(gap)){\n  gap <- 14\n  warning(\"gap was not a number, defaulting to 14 days\")\n}\n```\n\nFor maximum flexibility, I have parameterized the `enrollby`, `exitby`, and `gap` used by the algorithm to determine student moves. An astute observer of the function declaration may have noticed I did not set default values for `enrollby` or `exitby`. This is because these dates are naturally going to be different which each year of data. As a result, I want to enforce their explicit declaration. \n\nHowever, we all make mistakes. So when I check to see if `enrollby` or `exitby` are `missing()`, I do not stop the function if it returns `TRUE`. Instead, I set the value `enrollby` to September 15 in the year that matches the minimum (first) enrollment record and `exitby` to June 1 in the year that matches the maximum (last) exit record. I then pop off a `warning()` that informs the user the expected values for each parameter and what values I have defaulted them to. I chose to use `warning()` because many R users set their environment to halt at `warnings()`. They are generally not good and should be pursued and fixed. No one should depend upon the defaulting process I use in the function. But the defaults that can be determined programmatically are sensible enough that I did not feel the need to always halt the function in its place.\n\nI also check to see if `gap` is, in fact, defined as a number. If not, I also throw a `warning()` after setting `gap` equal to default value of `14`.\n\nIs this all of the type and error-checking I could have included? Probably not, but I think this represents a very sensible set that make this function much more generalizable outside of my coding environment. This kind of checking may be overkill for a project that is worked on independently and with a single data set, but colleagues, including your future self, will likely be thankful for their inclusion if any of your code is to be reused.\n\n### Initializing the Results\n\n```r\noutput <- data.frame(id = as.character(unique(df[[sid]])),\n                     moves = vector(mode = 'numeric', \n                                    length = length(unique(df[[sid]]))))\noutput <- data.table(output, key='id')\ndf <- arrange(df, sid, enroll_date)\n```\nMy naïve implementation uses a lot of `for` loops, a no-no when it comes to R performance. One way to make `for` loops a lot worse, and this is true in any language, is to reassign a variable within the loop. This means that each iteration has the overhead of creating and assigning that object. Especially when we are building up results for each observation, it is silly to do this. We know exactly how big the data will be and therefore only need to create the object once. We can then assign a much smaller part of that object (in this case, one value in a vector) rather than the whole object (a honking `data.table`).\n\nOur `output` object is what the function returns. It is a simple `data.table` containing all of the unique student identifiers and the number of `moves` recorded for each student.\n\nThe last line in this code chunk ensures that the data are arranged by the unique student identifier and enrollment date. This is key since the `for` loops assume that they are traversing a student's record sequentially.\n\n### Business Rule 1: The Latecomer\n```r\nfor(i in 1:(length(df[[sid]])-1)){\n  if(i>1 && df[sid][i,]!=df[sid][(i-1),]){\n    if(df[['enroll_date']][i]>enrollby){\n      output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L]\n    }\n  }else if(i==1){\n    if(df[['enroll_date']][i]>enrollby){\n    output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L]\n    }\n  }\n``` \nThe first bit of logic checks if `sid` in row `i` is not equal to the `sid` in the `i-1` row. In other words, is this the first time we are observing this student? If it is, then row `i` is the first observation for that student and therefore has the minimum enrollment date. The `enroll_date` is checked against `enrollby`. When `enroll_date` is after `enrollby`, then the `moves` attribute for that `sid` is incremented by 1. [^increments]\n\nNow, I didn't really mention the conditional that `i>1`. This is needed because there is no `i-1` observation for the very first row of the `data.table`. Therefore, `i==1` is a special case where we once again perform the same check for `enroll_date` and `enrollby`. The `i>1` condition is before the `&&` operator, which ensures the statement after the `&&` is not evaluated when the first conditional is `FALSE`. This avoids an \"out of bounds\"-type error where R tries to check `df[0]`.\n\n### Business Rule 5: The Feint\nYeah, yeah-- the business rule list above doesn't match the order of my function. That's ok. Remember, sometimes giving instructions to a computer does not follow the way you would organize instructions for humans.\n\nRemember, the function is traversing through our `data.frame` one row at a time. First I checked to see if the function is at the first record for a particular student. Now I check to see if there are any records after the current record.\n\n```r\n  if(df[sid][i,]==df[sid][(i+1),]){\n    if(as.numeric(difftime(df[['enroll_date']][i+1], \n                           df[['exit_date']][i], units='days')) < gap &\n       df[schid][(i+1),]==df[schid][i,]){\n        next\n    }else if ...\n```\nFor the case where the `i+1` record has the same `sid`, then the `enroll_date` of `i+1` is subtracted from the `exit_date` of `i` and checked against `gap`. If it is both less than `gap` and the `schid` of `i+1` is the same as `i`, then `next`, which basically breaks out of this conditional and moves on without altering moves. In other words, students who are in the same school with only a few days between the time they exited are not counting has having moved.\n\nThe `...` above is not the special `...` in R, rather, I'm continuing that line below.\n\n### Business Rule 3: The Smooth Mover\n\n```r\n  }else if(as.numeric(difftime(df[['enroll_date']][i+1], \n                               df[['exit_date']][i], \n                               units='days')) < gap){\n    output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L] \n  }else{ ...\n```\n\nHere we have the simple case where a student has moved to another school (recall, this is still within the `if` conditional where the next record is the same student as the current record) with a very short period of time between the `exit_date` at the current record and the `enroll_date` of the next record. This is considered a \"seamless\" move from one school to another, and therefore that student's moves are incremented by 1.\n\n### Business Rule 4: The Long Hop\nOur final scenario for a student moving between schools is when the gap between the `exit_date` at the `i` school and the `enroll_date` at the `i+1` school is large, defined as `> gap`. In this scenario, the assumption is that the student moved to a jurisdiction outside of the data set, such as out of district for district-level data or out of state for state level data, and enrolled in at least one school not present in their enrollment record. The result is these students receive `2 moves`-- one out from the `i` school to a missing school and one in to the `i+1` school from the missing school.\n\nThe code looks like this (again a repeat from the `else{...` above which was not using the `...` character):\n\n```r\n  }else{\n    output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+2L] \n  }\n}else...\n```\nThis ends with a `}` which closes the `if` conditional that checked if the `i+1` student was the same as the `i` student, leaving only one more business rule to check.\n\n### Business Rule 2: The Early Summer\n```r\n}else{\n  if(is.na(df[['exit_date']][i])){\n    next\n  }else if(df[['exit_date']][i] < exitby){\n        output[as.character(df[[sid]][i]), moves:=moves+1L]\n  }\n}\n```\nRecall that this `else` block is only called if `sid` of the `i+1` record is not the same as `i`. This means that this is the final entry for a particular student. First, I check to see if that student has a missing `exit_date` and if so charges no `move` to the student implementing the `next` statement to break out of this iteration of the loop. Students never have missing `enroll_date` for any of the data I have seen over 8 years. This is because most systems minimally autogenerate the `enroll_date` for the current date when a student first enters a student information system. However, sometimes districts forget to properly exit a student and are unable to supply an accurate `exit_date`. In a very small number of cases I have seen these missing dates. So I do not want the function to fail in this scenario. My solution here was simply to break out and move to the next iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, I apply the last rule, which compares the final `exit_date` for a student to `exitby`, incrementing `moves` if the student left prior to the end of the year and likely enrolled elsewhere before the summer.\n\nThe last step is to close the `for` loop and `return` our result:\n```r\n  }\n  return(output)\n}\n```\n\n## Version 2: 10x Speed And More Readable\nThe second version of this code is vastly quicker.\n\nThe opening portion of the code, including the error checking is essentially a repeat of before, as is the initialization of the output.\n\n```r\nmoves_calc <- function(df, \n                       enrollby,\n                       exitby,\n                       gap=14,\n                       sid='sasid', \n                       schid='schno',\n                       enroll_date='enroll_date',\n                       exit_date='exit_date'){\n  if(\"data.table\" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE){\n    install.packages(\"data.table\")\n  } \n  require(data.table)\n  if (!inherits(df[[enroll_date]], \"Date\") | !inherits(df[[exit_date]], \"Date\"))\n      stop(\"Both enroll_date and exit_date must be Date objects\")\n  if(missing(enrollby)){\n    enrollby <- as.Date(paste(year(min(df[[enroll_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                              '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n  }else{\n    if(is.na(as.Date(enrollby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\"))){\n      enrollby <- as.Date(paste(year(min(df[[enroll_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                                '-09-15', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n      warning(paste(\"enrollby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,\",\n                    \"defaulting to\", \n                    enrollby, sep=' '))\n    }else{\n      enrollby <- as.Date(enrollby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    }\n  }\n  if(missing(exitby)){\n    exitby <- as.Date(paste(year(max(df[[exit_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                            '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n  }else{\n    if(is.na(as.Date(exitby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\"))){\n      exitby <- as.Date(paste(year(max(df[[exit_date]], na.rm=TRUE)),\n                                '-06-01', sep=''), format='%Y-%m-%d')\n      warning(paste(\"exitby must be a string with format %Y-%m-%d,\",\n                    \"defaulting to\", \n                    exitby, sep=' '))\n    }else{\n      exitby <- as.Date(exitby, format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    }\n  }\n  if(!is.numeric(gap)){\n    gap <- 14\n    warning(\"gap was not a number, defaulting to 14 days\")\n  }\n  output <- data.frame(id = as.character(unique(df[[sid]])),\n                       moves = vector(mode = 'numeric', \n                                      length = length(unique(df[[sid]]))))\n```                                      \n\nWhere things start to get interesting is in the calculation of the number of student moves.\n\n### Handling Missing Data\nOne of the clever bits of code I forgot about when I initially tried to refactor Version 1 appears under \"Business Rule 2: The Early Summer\". When the `exit_date` is missing, this code simply breaks out of the loop:\n\n```r\n  if(is.na(df[['exit_date']][i])){\n    next\n```\n\nBecause the new code will not be utilizing `for` loops or really any more of the basic control flow, I had to device a different way to treat missing data. The steps to apply the business rules that I present below will fail spectacularly with missing data.\n\nSo the first thing that I do is select the students who have missing data, assign the `moves` in the `output` to `NA`, and then subset the data to exclude these students.\n\n```r\nincomplete <- df[!complete.cases(df[, c(enroll_date, exit_date)]), ]\nif(dim(incomplete)[1]>0){\n  output[which(output[['id']] %in% incomplete[[sid]]),][['moves']] <- NA\n}\noutput <- data.table(output, key='id')\ndf <- df[complete.cases(df[, c(enroll_date, exit_date)]), ]\ndt <- data.table(df, key=sid)\n```\n\n### Woe with `data.table`\nNow with the data complete and in a `data.table`, I have to do a little bit of work to assist with my frustrations with `data.table`. Because `data.table` does a lot of work with the `[` operator, I find it very challenging to use a string argument to reference a column in the data. So I just gave up and internally rename these attributes.\n\n```r\ndt$sasid <- as.factor(as.character(dt$sasid))\nsetnames(dt, names(dt)[which(names(dt) %in% enroll_date)], \"enroll_date\")\nsetnames(dt, names(dt)[which(names(dt) %in% exit_date)], \"exit_date\")\n```\n\n### Magic with `data.table`: Business Rules 1 and 2 in two lines each\nDespite by challenges with the way that `data.table` re-imagines `[`, it does allow for clear, simple syntax for complex processes. Gone are the `for` loops and conditional blocks. How does `data.table` allow me to quickly identified whether or not a students first or last enrollment are before or after my cutoffs?\n\n```r\nfirst <- dt[, list(enroll_date=min(enroll_date)), by=sid]\noutput[id %in% first[enroll_date>enrollby][[sid]], moves:=moves+1L]\nlast <- dt[, list(exit_date=max(exit_date)), by=sid]  \noutput[id %in% last[exit_date<exitby][[sid]], moves:=moves+1L]\n```\nLine 1 creates a `data.table` with the student identifier and a new `enroll_date` column that is equal to the minimum `enroll_date` for that student.\n\nThe second line is very challenging to parse if you've never used `data.table`. The first argument for `[` in `data.table` is a subset/select function. In this case,\n\n```r\nid %in% first[enroll_date>enrollby][[sid]]\n```\n\nmeans,\n\n>Select the rows in `first` where the `enroll_date` attribute (which was previously assigned as the minimum `enroll_date`) is less than the global function argument `enrollby` and check if the `id` of `output` is in the `sid` vector.\n\nSo `output` is being subset to only include those records that meet that condition, in other words, the students who should have a move because they entered the school year late. \n\nThe second argument of `[` for `data.tables` is explained in this footnote [^increments] if you're not familiar with it.\n\n### Recursion. Which is also known as recursion.\nThe logic for Business Rules 3-5 are substantially more complex. At first it was not plainly obvious how to avoid a slow `for` loop for this process. Each of the rules on switching schools requires an awareness of context-- how does one record of a student compare to the very next record for that student? \n\nThe breakthrough was thinking back to my single semester of computer science and the concept of recursion. I created a new function inside of this function that can count how many moves are associated with a set of enrollment records, ignoring the considerations in Business Rules 1 and 2. Here's my solution. I decided to include inline comments because I think it's easier to understand that way.\n\n```r\nschool_switch <- function(dt, x=0){\n  # This function accepts a data.table dt and initializes the output to 0.\n    if(dim(dt)[1]<2){\n    # When there is only one enrollment record, there are no school changes to\n    # apply rules 3-5. Therefore, the function returns the value of x. If the\n    # initial data.table contains a student with just one enrollment record, \n    # this function will return 0 since we initialize x as 0.\n      return(x)\n    }else{\n      # More than one record, find the minimum exit_date which is the \"first\"\n      # record\n      exit <- min(dt[, exit_date])\n      # Find out which school the \"first\" record was at.\n      exit_school <- dt[exit_date==exit][[schid]]\n      # Select which rows come after the \"first\" record and only keep them\n      # in the data.table\n      rows <- dt[, enroll_date] > exit\n      dt <- dt[rows,]\n      # Find the minimum enrollment date in the subsetted table. This is the\n      # enrollment that follows the identified exit record\n      enroll <- min(dt[, enroll_date])\n      # Find the school associated with that enrollment date\n      enroll_school <- dt[enroll_date==enroll][[schid]]\n      # When the difference between the enrollment and exit dates are less than\n      # the gap and the schools are the same, there are no moves. We assign y,\n      # our count of moves to x, whatever the number of moves were in this call\n      # of school_switch\n      if(difftime(min(dt[, enroll_date], na.rm=TRUE), exit) < gap &\n         exit_school==enroll_school){\n        y = x\n      # When the difference in days is less than the gap (and the schools are\n      # different), then our number of moves are incremented by 1.\n      }else if(difftime(min(dt[, enroll_date], na.rm=TRUE), exit) < gap){\n        y = x + 1L\n      }else{\n      # Whenever the dates are separated by more than the gap, regardless of which\n      # school a student is enrolled in at either point, we increment by two.\n        y = x + 2L\n      }\n      # Explained below outside of the code block.\n      school_switch(dt, y)\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThe recursive aspect of this method is calling `school_switch` within `school_switch` once the function reaches its end. Because I subset out the row with the minimum `exit_date`, the `data.table` has one row processed with each iteration of `school_switch`. By passing the number of moves, `y` back into `school_switch`, I am \"saving\" my work from each iteration. Only when a single row remains for a particular student does the function `return` a value.\n\nThis function is called using `data.table`'s special `.SD` object, which accesses the subset of the full `data.table` when using the `by` argument.\n\n```r\ndt[, moves:= school_switch(.SD), by=sid]\n```\n\nThis calls `school_switch` after splitting the `data.table` by each `sid` and then stitches the work back together, split-apply-combine style, resulting in a `data.table` with a set of `moves` per student identifier. With a little bit of clean up, I can simply add these moves to those recorded earlier in `output` based on Business Rules 1 and 2.\n\n```r\n  dt <- dt[,list(switches=unique(moves)), by=sid]\n  output[dt, moves:=moves+switches]\n  return(output)\n}\n```\n\n## Quick and Dirty `system.time`\n\n[^optimization]:  On a mid-2012 Macbook Air, the current mobility calculation is very effective with tens of thousands of student records and practical for use in the low-hundreds of thousands of records range.\n\n[^increments]: I thought I was going to use `data.table` for some of its speedier features as I wrote this initial function. I didn't in this go (though I do in Version 2). However, I do find the `data.table` syntax for assigning values to be really convenient, particularly the `:=` operator which is common in several other languages. In `data.table`, the syntax `dt[,name:=value]` assigns `value` to an exist (or new) column called `name`. Because of the need `select` operator in `data.table`, I can just use `dt[id,moves:=moves+1L]` to select only the rows where the table `key`, in this case `sid`, matches `id`, and then increment `moves`. Nice.\n",

				"title": "A New Calculation for Student Mobility",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>How do we calculate student mobility? I am currently soliciting responses from other data professionals across the country. But when I needed to produce mobility numbers for some of my work a couple of months ago, I decided to develop a set of business rules without any exposure to how the federal government, states, or other existing systems define mobility. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:ignorance\"><a href=\"#fn:ignorance\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I am fairly proud of my work on mobility. This post will review how I defined student mobility. I am hopeful that it matches or bests current techniques for calculating the number of schools a student has attended. In my next post, I will share the first two major versions of my implementation of these mobility business rules in <code>R</code>. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:learningexperience\"><a href=\"#fn:learningexperience\">2</a></sup> Together, these posts will represent the work I referred to in my previous post on the <a href=\"|filename|documentation-of-business-rules-and-analysis.md\">importance of documenting business rules and sharing code</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-rules\">The Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Working with district data presents a woefully incomplete picture of the education mobile students receive. Particularly in a state like Rhode Island, where our districts are only a few miles wide, there is substantial interdistrict mobility. When a student moves across district lines, their enrollment is not recorded in local district data. However, even with state level data, highly mobile students cross state lines and present incomplete data. A key consideration for calculating how many schools a student has attended in a particular year is capturing &ldquo;missing&rdquo; data sensibly.</p>\n\n<p>The typical structure of enrollment records looks something like this:</p>\n\n<p>| Unique Student ID | School Code | Enrollment Date | Exit Date ||\n|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;|\n| 1000000           | 10101       | 2012-09-01      | 2012-11-15 |\n| 1000000           | 10103       | 2012-11-16      | 2013-06-15 |</p>\n\n<p>A compound key for this data consists of the Unique Student ID, School Code, and Enrollment Date, meaning that each row must be a unique combination of these three factors. The data above shows a simple case of a student enrolling at the start of the school year, switching schools once with no gap in enrollment, and continuing at the new school until the end of the school year. For the purposes of mobility, I would define the above as having moved one time.</p>\n\n<p>But it is easy to see how some very complex scenarios could quickly arise. What if student <code>1000000</code>&rsquo;s record looked like this?</p>\n\n<p>| Unique Student ID | School Code | Enrollment Date | Exit Date ||\n|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;|\n| 1000000           | 10101       | 2012-10-15      | 2012-11-15 |\n| 1000000           | 10103       | 2013-01-03      | 2013-03-13 |\n| 1000000           | 10103       | 2013-03-20      | 2013-05-13 |</p>\n\n<p>There are several features that make it challenging to assign a number of &ldquo;moves&rdquo; to this student. First, the student does not enroll in school until October 15, 2012. This is nearly six weeks into the typical school year in the Northeastern United States. Should we assume that this student has enrolled in no school at all prior to October 15th or should we assume that the student was enrolled in a school that was outside of this district and therefore missing in the data? Next, we notice the enrollment gap between November 15, 2012 and January 3, 2013. Is it right to assume that the student has moved only once in this period of time with a gap of enrollment of over a month and a half? Then we notice that the student exited school <code>10103</code> on March 13, 2013 but was re-enrolled in the same school a week later on March 20, 2013. Has the student truly &ldquo;moved&rdquo; in this period? Lastly, the student exits the district on May 13, 2013 for the final time. This is nearly a month before the end of school. Has this student moved to a different school?</p>\n\n<p>There is an element missing that most enrollment data has which can enrich our understanding of this student&rsquo;s record. All district collect an exit type, which explains if a student is leaving to enroll in another school within the district, another school in a different district in the same state, another school in a different state, a private school, etc. It also defines whether a student is dropping out, graduating, or has entered the juvenile justice system, for example. However, it has been my experience that this data is reported inconsistently and unreliably. Frequently a student will be reported as changing schools within the district without a subsequent enrollment record, or reported as leaving the district but enroll within the same district a few days later. Therefore, I think that we should try and infer the number of schools that a student has attended using soley the enrollment date, exit date, and school code for each student record. This data is far more reliable for a host of reasons, and, ultimately, provides us with all the information we need to make intelligent decisions.</p>\n\n<p>My proposed set of business rules examines <code>school code</code>, <code>enrollment date</code>, and <code>exit date</code> against three parameters: <code>enrollment by</code>, <code>exit by</code>, and <code>gap</code>.\nEach students minimum enrollment date is compared to <code>enrollment by</code>.

				"content_text": "\nHow do we calculate student mobility? I am currently soliciting responses from other data professionals across the country. But when I needed to produce mobility numbers for some of my work a couple of months ago, I decided to develop a set of business rules without any exposure to how the federal government, states, or other existing systems define mobility. [^ignorance]\n\nI am fairly proud of my work on mobility. This post will review how I defined student mobility. I am hopeful that it matches or bests current techniques for calculating the number of schools a student has attended. In my next post, I will share the first two major versions of my implementation of these mobility business rules in `R`. [^learningexperience] Together, these posts will represent the work I referred to in my previous post on the [importance of documenting business rules and sharing code](|filename|documentation-of-business-rules-and-analysis.md).\n\n## The Rules\nWorking with district data presents a woefully incomplete picture of the education mobile students receive. Particularly in a state like Rhode Island, where our districts are only a few miles wide, there is substantial interdistrict mobility. When a student moves across district lines, their enrollment is not recorded in local district data. However, even with state level data, highly mobile students cross state lines and present incomplete data. A key consideration for calculating how many schools a student has attended in a particular year is capturing \"missing\" data sensibly.\n\nThe typical structure of enrollment records looks something like this:\n\n| Unique Student ID | School Code | Enrollment Date | Exit Date ||\n|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|\n| 1000000           | 10101       | 2012-09-01      | 2012-11-15 |\n| 1000000           | 10103       | 2012-11-16      | 2013-06-15 |\n\nA compound key for this data consists of the Unique Student ID, School Code, and Enrollment Date, meaning that each row must be a unique combination of these three factors. The data above shows a simple case of a student enrolling at the start of the school year, switching schools once with no gap in enrollment, and continuing at the new school until the end of the school year. For the purposes of mobility, I would define the above as having moved one time.\n\nBut it is easy to see how some very complex scenarios could quickly arise. What if student `1000000`'s record looked like this?\n\n| Unique Student ID | School Code | Enrollment Date | Exit Date ||\n|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|\n| 1000000           | 10101       | 2012-10-15      | 2012-11-15 |\n| 1000000           | 10103       | 2013-01-03      | 2013-03-13 |\n| 1000000           | 10103       | 2013-03-20      | 2013-05-13 |\n\nThere are several features that make it challenging to assign a number of \"moves\" to this student. First, the student does not enroll in school until October 15, 2012. This is nearly six weeks into the typical school year in the Northeastern United States. Should we assume that this student has enrolled in no school at all prior to October 15th or should we assume that the student was enrolled in a school that was outside of this district and therefore missing in the data? Next, we notice the enrollment gap between November 15, 2012 and January 3, 2013. Is it right to assume that the student has moved only once in this period of time with a gap of enrollment of over a month and a half? Then we notice that the student exited school `10103` on March 13, 2013 but was re-enrolled in the same school a week later on March 20, 2013. Has the student truly \"moved\" in this period? Lastly, the student exits the district on May 13, 2013 for the final time. This is nearly a month before the end of school. Has this student moved to a different school?\n\nThere is an element missing that most enrollment data has which can enrich our understanding of this student's record. All district collect an exit type, which explains if a student is leaving to enroll in another school within the district, another school in a different district in the same state, another school in a different state, a private school, etc. It also defines whether a student is dropping out, graduating, or has entered the juvenile justice system, for example. However, it has been my experience that this data is reported inconsistently and unreliably. Frequently a student will be reported as changing schools within the district without a subsequent enrollment record, or reported as leaving the district but enroll within the same district a few days later. Therefore, I think that we should try and infer the number of schools that a student has attended using soley the enrollment date, exit date, and school code for each student record. This data is far more reliable for a host of reasons, and, ultimately, provides us with all the information we need to make intelligent decisions.\n\nMy proposed set of business rules examines `school code`, `enrollment date`, and `exit date` against three parameters: `enrollment by`, `exit by`, and `gap`. \nEach students minimum enrollment date is compared to `enrollment by`. If that student entered the data set for the first time before the `enrollment by`, the assumption is that this record represents the first time the student enrolls in any school for that year, and therefore the student has 0 `moves`. If the student enrolls for the first time after `enrollment by`, then the record is considered the second school a student has attended and their `moves` attribute is incremented by `1`. Similarly, if a student's maximium `exit date` is after `exit by`, then this considered to be the student's last school enrolled in for the year and they are credited with `0` `moves`, but if `exit date` is prior to `exit by`, then that student's `moves` is incremented by `1`.\n\nThat takes care of the \"ends\", but what happens as students switch schools in the \"middle\"? I proposed that each `exit date` is compared to the subsequent `enrollment date`. If `enrollment date` occurs within `gap` days of the previous `exit date`, and the `school code` of enrollment is not the same as the `school code` of exit, then a student's `moves` are incremented by `1`. If the `school codes` are identical and the difference between dates is less than `gap`, then the student is said to have not moved at all. If the difference between the `enrollment date` and the previous `exit date` is greater than `gap`, then the student's `moves` is incremented by `2`, the assumption being that the student likely attended a different school between the two observations in the data.\n\nWhereas calculating student mobility may have seemed a simple matter of counting the number of records in the enrollment file, clearly there is a level of complexity this would fail to capture.\n\nCheck back in a few days to see my next post where I will share my initial implementation of these business rules and how I achieved an 10x speed up with a massive code refactor.\n\n[^ignorance]: My ignorance was intentional. It is good to stretch those brain muscles that think through sticky problems like developing business rules for a key statistic. I can't be sure that I have developed the most considered and complete set of rules for mobility, which is why I'm now soliciting other's views, but I am hopeful my solution is at least as good.\n\n[^learningexperience]: I think showing my first two implementation of these business rules is an excellent opportunity to review several key design considerations when programming in `R`.

				"title": "Some Changes for Rhode Island State Aid to Education",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>In December 2009, the education department head, Professor Kenneth K. Wong, another graduate student and myself were part of a three-person team consulting the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) on how to establish a new state funding formula. We worked with finance and legal staff at the department to develop the legislation for the 2010 session that would establish a state funding formula for the first time in 15 years.\n\u2028\nThe Board of Regents had already passed a resolution with its policy priorities that they wanted enshrined in the formula. Additionally, there had been many attempts over the past 5-10 years to pass a new formula that failed for various reasons, chief among them that all previously proposed formulas were accompanied with a call to increase state funding for education 30-50%, with some even envisioning nearly doubling the state education funding. Our task was to research funding formulas, both in practice in other states and in the literature research on school finance, and achieve the goals of the Board of Regents without proposing a mammoth increase in state aid that would sink the entire endeavor <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:increase\"><a href=\"#fn:increase\">1</a></sup>. The general sense was that while more state aid had the potential to improve the progressiveness of education expenditures, the reality is the overall spending level in Rhode Island is high, and introducing new money was less important than redistributing state aid. I share this belief, particularly because I think adding money to the right places is simple once there is already a way to equitably distribute those funds. Tying up the increase in funding alongside a distribution method is a recipe for political horse-trading that can result in all kinds of distortions that prevent aid from flowing where needed.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>My role in this process was primarily to create Excel simulators that would allow us to immediately track the impacts of changing different parts of the formula. I also helped RIDE staff interpret the meaning of changes to the math behind the funding formula and understand what levers existed to change the formula and how these changes impacted both the resulting distribution and policy.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>We had three months.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of people who are unhappy about the results of the formula that ultimately passed in June 2010. Because we are redistributing essentially the same amount of state aid, there are some districts that are losing money while others are gaining funds <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:holdharmless\"><a href=\"#fn:holdharmless\">2</a></sup>. Some dislike the fact that we used only a &ldquo;weight&rdquo; for free and reduced price lunch status. Alternative formulas (and formulas in other states) typically include numerous weights, from limited English proficiency and special education status, to gifted and talented and career and technical education <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:ajello\"><a href=\"#fn:ajello\">3</a></sup>. And yet others were displeased that many costs, including transportation and facilities maintenance, were excluded from the state-base of education aid. Then there are those who think the transition is all off&ndash; five years is too long to wait to get the increases the formula proposes, and ten years is far too fast to lose the money the formula proposes. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:transitions\"><a href=\"#fn:transitions\">4</a></sup>\u2028</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-good-state-aid-system\">A Good State Aid System\u2028</h3>\n\n<p>In the end, I am proud of the formula produced for several reasons.\u2028\nFirst, it passed successfully and has been fully funded (and sometimes more than fully funded) each year of implementation throughout a period of massive structural budget deficits. This is no small accomplishment. The advocacy community rightfully pushes us to build ideal systems, but in our role of policy entrepreneurs we are faced with the reality that a policy that does not become law and is not supported as law may as well not exist. Producing a formula that has some of the other positive qualities discussed below, passing that formula, and implementing the formula with little fanfare is not a small accomplishment.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Second, the formula is highly progressive, sending as much as 20 times more aid to some of our poorest communities in Rhode Island compared to the wealthiest. I am not positive how this compares to other states&ndash; that&rsquo;s a topic I certainly want to work on for a future post&ndash; but with just 39 cities and towns, it seems to show a high preference for <em>vertical equity</em>, treating different cities and towns differently. There are communities on both ends of the distribution who want substantially more state funding, and our state aid formula is not sufficient to effectively crowd out local capacity for education spending and ensure that our poorest communities are spending more than our wealthier ones <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:comparative\"><a href=\"#fn:comparative\">5</a></sup>, but it&rsquo;s a very strong start.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Third, the formula is relatively simple. While I do not necessarily agree that it is a virtue to have fewer weights and a simple formula in perpetuity, the experience with other states and other formula-based programs show that weights and complexities are very easy to add and very hard to take away. Once a particular policy preference is enshrined in the distribution method, it had better be right because a community of advocacy will maintain that weight long into the future. Personally, I felt it critical to start with the very simple &ldquo;core&rdquo; formula that could be adjusted over time. I have some ideas on how I might modify/add to this core that I will be sharing in this post, but I firmly believe that starting with a simple core was the right move. It is also worth noting that because of the need to ensure the transition is smoothed out so that gains in some districts equal the total losses in the others meant that even a more progressive weighting scheme would not impact school funding until the far back end of the transition period (which we proposed as 7 years but was pushed to 5 years during the legislative process), since communities were already gaining funds as fast as we could move them. For this reason, not only was a simple core preferable from my technocratic perspective, but it also was not likely to have any immediate downside.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, we removed the long-term regionalization bonuses. Rhode Island had sought to reduce the ridiculous number of school districts by providing a bonus for regionalizing in the early 90s. Unfortunately, because of the timing of the abandonment of the previous state aid formula, the districts that did choose to regionalize had their base funding locked in at a level 6-8% higher than it should have been, because they were receiving a bonus that was meant to fade away over the course of several years. I could justify a small increase in state funding to pay some of the transition expenses of regionalizing districts, but long term funding increases? Part of the goal of regionalization is the reduction of overhead that allows for decreased costs (or increased services at the same costs). There is no ongoing need to supply a massive state bonus for regionalizing.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Now just because I am proud of this work does not mean that I think we have &ldquo;solved&rdquo; education funding in Rhode Island. Personally, I believe there are other defensible ways to distribute funding in Rhode Island, each of which represents slightly different policy preferences. There is no hard and fast &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; way to do this, within certain guidelines. As I see it, so long as the formula is progressive and moving toward a greater chance of seeing a day where Providence has the highest paid staff in the state <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:comparative\"><a href=\"#fn:comparative\">5</a></sup>, we are on the right path. I don&rsquo;t believe that Rhode Island will have a truly &ldquo;great&rdquo; education finance climate without a substantial growth in the economy or a huge new tax that dramatically lowers the ability of municipalities to generate school funding while bolstering state aid. However, I think we have a great foundation and a &ldquo;good&rdquo; system.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>For the remainder of this post, I would like to propose a few ideas that could help move Rhode Island from &ldquo;good&rdquo; to &ldquo;very good&rdquo; that I think are feasible within the next five years <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:goodtogreat\"><a href=\"#fn:goodtogreat\">6</a></sup>.\u2028</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-very-good-state-aid-program\">A Very Good State Aid Program\u2028</h3>\n\n<p>After a little over three years since its establishment, I think we are ready to tackle several additional aspects of state education funding in Rhode Island. One thing you may notice is that few of these ideas impact the original formula. Part of why that is comes from my aforementioned preference for a simple formula, and part is because these include some non-formula issues that were not pursued in 2010 in an effort to keep the focus on the main policy matters.\u2028\nFirst, and perhaps the most consequential change that can be made to state funding, is the teacher pension fund payments. Currently, the state and local districts split the cost of teacher pension contributions 60/40. This is a flat split, regardless of the wealth of the community. I think it&rsquo;s absurd to ignore community wealth for such a large portion of state education expenditures. Using the Adjusted Equalized Weighted Assessment Values (AEWAV) to determine the reimbursement rates would be a big improvement on the progressiveness of school funding.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Second, I would make a slight change to the way that we fund charter schools. When we were developing the formula, there was broad agreement among policymakers that the &ldquo;money should follow the child&rdquo;. In one sense, this is the system we proposed since school district funding is based on enrollments. However, I think an irrational desire to not &ldquo;double count&rdquo; students, alongside the need to keep funding as flat as possible, pushed the formula a bit too far when it comes to charters. The old way of funding charter schools allowed districts to hold back 5% of the total per pupil expenditure from their charter school tuitions. This meant charter schools received 5% less funding than traditional public schools, but it also recognized that there are some fixed costs in districts that are not immediately recoverable when students leave on the margins. I think the state should return to this practice, however only if the state is willing to pay the withheld 5% to charters. I do think its fair to take into account some fixed costs, but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s fair that charter schools received less funding as a result.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Third, we excluded all building maintenance costs from the base amount of state aid. This was largely because the formula was supposed to represent only the marginal instructional costs associated with each student. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that these costs have to be added into the base amount. However, I would like to see the state contribute to the maintenance of buildings more directly. I think the state should provide a flat dollar amount, say &#36;100,000, per building in each district, provided that key criteria are met. The buildings should be at 90% occupancy/utilization, should have a minimum size set based on the research on efficiency (roughly 300 students at the elementary level and 600 students for high schools), and there should be some minimum standard for building systems quality and upkeep. These requirements are mostly about making sure this flat fund, which is really about the fixed costs of maintaining buildings, doesn&rsquo;t create incentives to build more. It may seem inconsequential, but I think it&rsquo;s important to state the preference for well-sized, occupied <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:occupied\"><a href=\"#fn:occupied\">7</a></sup>, and maintained buildings is worthwhile.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s wrong that the minimum reimbursement rate for school construction aid was raised to 40% during the funding formula debates in the General Assembly. This amounts to a massive subsidy for suburban schools and the previous 30% minimum is part of why we have such stark facilities inequities in the state. We should remove the minimums on construction reimbursement and simply use AEWAV to determine the reimbursement rate. Also, we need to establish a revolving facilities loan fund, much like the one used for sewers (and now <a href=\"http://blogs.wpri.com/2013/03/21/ricwfa-explainer/\">roads and bridges</a>). Access to lower interest bonds should not be dependent on city finances.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, one thing we did not include in the original funding formula that has come under considerably criticism is a special weight for students who are labeled English language learners. There are a few reasons we made this decision. The districts that have ELLs are the same districts that have high levels of poverty. In fact, the five communities that had more than 5% of their students classified as ELLs were, in order, also the top five districts with regards to free and reduced price lunch eligibility. Combined with a transition plan that was already increasing funding to these districts as rapidly as could be afforded, there were virtually no short-term consequences of not including an ELL weight. It&rsquo;s worth noting that formula dollars are not categorical funds&ndash; there are no restrictions on how districts should spend this money, and there are no guarantees that an ELL weight would have any impact on ELL spending.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>We were also concerned with incentivizing over-identification and failing to exit students who should no longer be classified as ELLs. I am also personally concerned with mistaking the additional supports we want to target as needed for English language acquisition; it would not only inspire the wrong policies and supports for these students, but it fails to recognize a host of needs that persist for these students well beyond English acquisition.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>During the funding formula hearings at House and Senate Finance Committees we discussed the need for further study on this issue. I think that the next weight in the formula should be based on the Census and American Communities Survey. By using these data sets, classification of students who are eligible for the weight would not be dependent on the school district itself. Rather than focus on child language acquisition, I think we should broaden this weight to be applied based on the percentage of households that speak a language other than English in the home, where English is spoken at a level below &ldquo;very well&rdquo; <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:technical\"><a href=\"#fn:technical\">8</a></sup>. This would ensure that students who live in language minority households receive additional supports throughout their education, regardless of their language acquisition status. I would make this weight lower than some in the literature because it would apply to a broader set of students, probably somewhere around 40% like the poverty weight. For reference, the latest five-year estimate from the ACS data shows that 24.3% of households fit this definition in the city of Providence. With a 40% weight, at 22,500 students, with a foundation amount of around \\$9,000 per student, this weight would increase funding to Providence by a little over \\$16,000,000. Similar to other formula aid, these funds would be unrestricted.\u2028</p>\n\n<p>Now, while I think that \\$16,000,000 is no small potatoes, and I am happy to express our policy preference to drive funding into communities where families are not using English in the home, some perspective is warranted. Providence will receive almost \\$240,000,000 in state aid when the formula is fully transitioned, compared to about \\$190,000,000 before. Adding this weight would only represent a 6% increase in state aid from the full formula amount. It&rsquo;s an important increase, but I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me if I felt it was not grossly unfair to exclude it in the first iteration of the funding formula, especially considering we still have not fully transitioned to those higher dollar amounts sent to districts that would benefit from these funds.\u2028</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"it-takes-money\">It Takes Money\u2028</h3>\n\n<p>Each of these recommendations, in my view, would improve the way that Rhode Island distributes education aid. Some of the changes are technical, others address areas that are currently not considered, and some are purely about increasing the progressiveness of aid. All of these changes will require an even greater state contribution to education aid, but these increases would be an order of magnitude lower than what it would take to increase the state aid to covering 50-60% of all education expenditures. While I would support some pretty radical changes to drive more money into the state aid system, I think that each of these improvements are worth doing on the path to increased aid.\u2028</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:increase\">I should note, that few people I spoke to were not in favor of raising the amount of state aid. We all want more money to come from the state because those dollars are far more progressive. However, Rhode Island was deep in its recession at this point in time and the dollar amounts to make a real dent in the state to local share in education are just staggering. Rhode Island currently funds just short of 40% of total school expenditures at the state level. To increase that to 60%, which is closer to the national average, they would have to contribute &#36;500M more&ndash; a roughly 60% increase from the current level. Just for some context, the main tax fight of Rhode Island progressives has been to repeal tax cuts for higher income individuals that were instituted starting in 2006 in an attempt to move toward a flat income tax rate in Rhode Island. The impact of this repeal would be an increase in revenues that would cover roughly 10% of the increase in school funding required to move from 40% to 60% state aid. Of course, those dollars are supposed to pay for some portion of restoring pension benefits, so it&rsquo;s already spoken for.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:increase\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:holdharmless\">Hold harmless provisions, when introduced in other states, serve to dramatically distort the redistributive properties of state aid and almost always require a huge influx of funds. In fact, a hold harmless provision in Rhode Island would have required a doubling of state aid, which ultimately would have guaranteed that wealthy communities continue to receive too much state aid while less wealthy communities are stuck fighting year after year for tremendous revenue increases through taxation just to get their fair share. Essentially, hold harmless would ensure that you never reach formula-level spending and guarantee that state aid would not be very progressive.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:holdharmless\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:ajello\">One very popular progressive member of the Rhode Island General Assembly had been working for years to pass a new funding formula and had five or six such weights in her version. Interestingly, with the glaring exception of sending &#36;0 to Newport in state aid, the difference in the overall distribution of funds by district in Rhode Island using this formula and our formula was tiny, almost always &lt;5%.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:ajello\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:transitions\">Smoothing the &ldquo;gains&rdquo; and &ldquo;losses&rdquo; overtime was important to keep the formula as close to revenue neutral as possible. Of course, there are increases due to inflation and other factors each year as a part of the base, but our goal was to truly redistribute the funds such that not only is the end number not a big increase in total state aid but that getting through the transition period did not have huge costs. If it did, there is no way we could feel confident we would ever reach the point where the formula actually dictated state aid, much like the hold harmless provision prevents a full transition. Modeling various transition plans was a nightmare for me.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:transitions\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:comparative\">Many people forget that education spending is about competition within a single market. Overall spending matters less within this market than how you spend compared to others. The trick is that an urban school primarily working with traditionally under served families needs to be able to pay not just for more material supplies, but mostly for higher quality teachers and staff (and perhaps quantity). Because of compensating wage differentials, even hiring teachers and staff that are the same quality as wealthy communities costs more.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:comparative\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:goodtogreat\">Perhaps I will write a future post on some ideas of how to push Rhode Island to &ldquo;great&rdquo;, even though I view all of those solutions as politically impossible.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:goodtogreat\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:occupied\">I would include any leased space as occupied.

This definition is clunky, but its how the ACS and Census track these things. We could verify the data using the data reported by districts about language spoken in the home. I would recommend using this data point to assist with whether or not to include these weights for charter schools. For example, approximately half of those families that do not speak English in the home also speak English very poorly. Therefore, I might apply half of the weight to each individual child whose family reports speaking a language other than English at home. Of course, the actual proportion of the weight should be specific to the ratio of speakers of language other than English to non-very well speakers of English by community.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:technical\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",
				"content_text": "\nIn December 2009, the education department head, Professor Kenneth K. Wong, another graduate student and myself were part of a three-person team consulting the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) on how to establish a new state funding formula. We worked with finance and legal staff at the department to develop the legislation for the 2010 session that would establish a state funding formula for the first time in 15 years.\n\u2028\nThe Board of Regents had already passed a resolution with its policy priorities that they wanted enshrined in the formula. Additionally, there had been many attempts over the past 5-10 years to pass a new formula that failed for various reasons, chief among them that all previously proposed formulas were accompanied with a call to increase state funding for education 30-50%, with some even envisioning nearly doubling the state education funding. Our task was to research funding formulas, both in practice in other states and in the literature research on school finance, and achieve the goals of the Board of Regents without proposing a mammoth increase in state aid that would sink the entire endeavor [^increase]. The general sense was that while more state aid had the potential to improve the progressiveness of education expenditures, the reality is the overall spending level in Rhode Island is high, and introducing new money was less important than redistributing state aid. I share this belief, particularly because I think adding money to the right places is simple once there is already a way to equitably distribute those funds. Tying up the increase in funding alongside a distribution method is a recipe for political horse-trading that can result in all kinds of distortions that prevent aid from flowing where needed.\u2028\n\nMy role in this process was primarily to create Excel simulators that would allow us to immediately track the impacts of changing different parts of the formula. I also helped RIDE staff interpret the meaning of changes to the math behind the funding formula and understand what levers existed to change the formula and how these changes impacted both the resulting distribution and policy.\u2028\n\nWe had three months.\u2028\n\nThere are a lot of people who are unhappy about the results of the formula that ultimately passed in June 2010. Because we are redistributing essentially the same amount of state aid, there are some districts that are losing money while others are gaining funds [^holdharmless]. Some dislike the fact that we used only a \"weight\" for free and reduced price lunch status. Alternative formulas (and formulas in other states) typically include numerous weights, from limited English proficiency and special education status, to gifted and talented and career and technical education [^ajello]. And yet others were displeased that many costs, including transportation and facilities maintenance, were excluded from the state-base of education aid. Then there are those who think the transition is all off-- five years is too long to wait to get the increases the formula proposes, and ten years is far too fast to lose the money the formula proposes. [^transitions]\u2028\n\n### A Good State Aid System\u2028\n\nIn the end, I am proud of the formula produced for several reasons.\u2028\nFirst, it passed successfully and has been fully funded (and sometimes more than fully funded) each year of implementation throughout a period of massive structural budget deficits. This is no small accomplishment. The advocacy community rightfully pushes us to build ideal systems, but in our role of policy entrepreneurs we are faced with the reality that a policy that does not become law and is not supported as law may as well not exist. Producing a formula that has some of the other positive qualities discussed below, passing that formula, and implementing the formula with little fanfare is not a small accomplishment.\u2028\n\nSecond, the formula is highly progressive, sending as much as 20 times more aid to some of our poorest communities in Rhode Island compared to the wealthiest. I am not positive how this compares to other states-- that's a topic I certainly want to work on for a future post-- but with just 39 cities and towns, it seems to show a high preference for *vertical equity*, treating different cities and towns differently. There are communities on both ends of the distribution who want substantially more state funding, and our state aid formula is not sufficient to effectively crowd out local capacity for education spending and ensure that our poorest communities are spending more than our wealthier ones [^comparative], but it's a very strong start.\u2028\n\nThird, the formula is relatively simple. While I do not necessarily agree that it is a virtue to have fewer weights and a simple formula in perpetuity, the experience with other states and other formula-based programs show that weights and complexities are very easy to add and very hard to take away. Once a particular policy preference is enshrined in the distribution method, it had better be right because a community of advocacy will maintain that weight long into the future. Personally, I felt it critical to start with the very simple \"core\" formula that could be adjusted over time. I have some ideas on how I might modify/add to this core that I will be sharing in this post, but I firmly believe that starting with a simple core was the right move. It is also worth noting that because of the need to ensure the transition is smoothed out so that gains in some districts equal the total losses in the others meant that even a more progressive weighting scheme would not impact school funding until the far back end of the transition period (which we proposed as 7 years but was pushed to 5 years during the legislative process), since communities were already gaining funds as fast as we could move them. For this reason, not only was a simple core preferable from my technocratic perspective, but it also was not likely to have any immediate downside.\u2028\n\nFourth, we removed the long-term regionalization bonuses. Rhode Island had sought to reduce the ridiculous number of school districts by providing a bonus for regionalizing in the early 90s. Unfortunately, because of the timing of the abandonment of the previous state aid formula, the districts that did choose to regionalize had their base funding locked in at a level 6-8% higher than it should have been, because they were receiving a bonus that was meant to fade away over the course of several years. I could justify a small increase in state funding to pay some of the transition expenses of regionalizing districts, but long term funding increases? Part of the goal of regionalization is the reduction of overhead that allows for decreased costs (or increased services at the same costs). There is no ongoing need to supply a massive state bonus for regionalizing.\u2028\n\nNow just because I am proud of this work does not mean that I think we have \"solved\" education funding in Rhode Island. Personally, I believe there are other defensible ways to distribute funding in Rhode Island, each of which represents slightly different policy preferences. There is no hard and fast \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to do this, within certain guidelines. As I see it, so long as the formula is progressive and moving toward a greater chance of seeing a day where Providence has the highest paid staff in the state [^comparative], we are on the right path. I don't believe that Rhode Island will have a truly \"great\" education finance climate without a substantial growth in the economy or a huge new tax that dramatically lowers the ability of municipalities to generate school funding while bolstering state aid. However, I think we have a great foundation and a \"good\" system.\u2028\n\nFor the remainder of this post, I would like to propose a few ideas that could help move Rhode Island from \"good\" to \"very good\" that I think are feasible within the next five years [^goodtogreat].\u2028\n\n### A Very Good State Aid Program\u2028\n\nAfter a little over three years since its establishment, I think we are ready to tackle several additional aspects of state education funding in Rhode Island. One thing you may notice is that few of these ideas impact the original formula. Part of why that is comes from my aforementioned preference for a simple formula, and part is because these include some non-formula issues that were not pursued in 2010 in an effort to keep the focus on the main policy matters.\u2028\nFirst, and perhaps the most consequential change that can be made to state funding, is the teacher pension fund payments.

This was largely because the formula was supposed to represent only the marginal instructional costs associated with each student. I don't necessarily think that these costs have to be added into the base amount. However, I would like to see the state contribute to the maintenance of buildings more directly. I think the state should provide a flat dollar amount, say &#36;100,000, per building in each district, provided that key criteria are met. The buildings should be at 90% occupancy/utilization, should have a minimum size set based on the research on efficiency (roughly 300 students at the elementary level and 600 students for high schools), and there should be some minimum standard for building systems quality and upkeep. These requirements are mostly about making sure this flat fund, which is really about the fixed costs of maintaining buildings, doesn't create incentives to build more. It may seem inconsequential, but I think it's important to state the preference for well-sized, occupied [^occupied], and maintained buildings is worthwhile.\u2028\n\nI think it's wrong that the minimum reimbursement rate for school construction aid was raised to 40% during the funding formula debates in the General Assembly. This amounts to a massive subsidy for suburban schools and the previous 30% minimum is part of why we have such stark facilities inequities in the state. We should remove the minimums on construction reimbursement and simply use AEWAV to determine the reimbursement rate.

Of course, there are increases due to inflation and other factors each year as a part of the base, but our goal was to truly redistribute the funds such that not only is the end number not a big increase in total state aid but that getting through the transition period did not have huge costs. If it did, there is no way we could feel confident we would ever reach the point where the formula actually dictated state aid, much like the hold harmless provision prevents a full transition. Modeling various transition plans was a nightmare for me.\n\n[^comparative]: Many people forget that education spending is about competition within a single market. Overall spending matters less within this market than how you spend compared to others. The trick is that an urban school primarily working with traditionally under served families needs to be able to pay not just for more material supplies, but mostly for higher quality teachers and staff (and perhaps quantity). Because of compensating wage differentials, even hiring teachers and staff that are the same quality as wealthy communities costs more.\n\n[^goodtogreat]: Perhaps I will write a future post on some ideas of how to push Rhode Island to \"great\", even though I view all of those solutions as politically impossible.\n\n[^occupied]: I would include any leased space as occupied. We should encourage full utilization of the buildings, whether that includes charter schools, central office use, city government, or private companies. \n\n[^technical]: This definition is clunky, but its how the ACS and Census track these things. This definition is clunky, but its how the ACS and Census track these things. We could verify the data using the data reported by districts about language spoken in the home. I would recommend using this data point to assist with whether or not to include these weights for charter schools. For example, approximately half of those families that do not speak English in the home also speak English very poorly. Therefore, I might apply half of the weight to each individual child whose family reports speaking a language other than English at home. Of course, the actual proportion of the weight should be specific to the ratio of speakers of language other than English to non-very well speakers of English by community.\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>This summer has been very productive for my fiction reading backlog. Here are just some of the things I have read since Memorial Day. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:affiliatescum\"><a href=\"#fn:affiliatescum\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"novels\">Novels</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-name-of-the-wind-by-patrick-rothfuss\">The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss</h3>\n\n<p>I picked up <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0756405890/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20\">The Name of the Wind</a> on a whim while cruising through the bookstore. I was glad I did. This book tells a classic story&ndash; a precocious young wizard learns to use his powers, building toward being the most important person in the world. The book is framed around an innkeeper and his apprentice who are more than they seem. When a man claiming to be the most famous storyteller in the land enters the inn, we learn that our innkeeper has past filled with spectacular exploits that our bard wants to record. Lucky for our reader, Kvothe, in addition to be a warrior-wizard of extraordinary talent, is a narcissist who decides to tell his whole story just this once to this most famous of all chroniclers. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:narcissist\"><a href=\"#fn:narcissist\">2</a></sup> Although I have spoken to several folks who found Kvothe to be utterly unlikeable because of both his sly form of arrogance and Rothfuss&rsquo;s decision to seemingly make Kvothe worthy of such high self-worth, I loved this book.</p>\n\n<p>In this first book of the <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em> (as these things tend to be named), we learn all about Kvothe&rsquo;s formative years. We spend substantial time exploring dark times in Kvothe&rsquo;s life when he endures tragedy, trauma, and horrible poverty before finally beginning to learn how to truly use his talents. It is a fair critique that Kvothe seems almost &ldquo;too good&rdquo;, but much of the story is about how skill, luck, and folly all contribute to his success and fame, much of which is based on exaggerated tellings of true events.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a fan of this sort of fantasy, with magic, destiny, love, power, and coming of age, I recommend picking up this book. Rothfuss has a gift. The sequel, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0756407915/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20\">The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear</a> is already available, and I will certainly be reading it before the end of the summer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"endymion-and-the-rise-of-endymion-by-dan-simmons\">Endymion and The Rise of Endymion by Dan Simmons</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553572946/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20\">Endymion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553572989/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20\">The Rise of Endymion</a> are the must anticipated (15 years ago) follow up to Dan Simmons&rsquo;s brilliant <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553283685/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20\">Hyperion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553288202/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20\">Fall of Hyperion</a>. I strongly recommend the originals, which is one of the greatest tales in all of science fiction. I also recommend creating some distance between reading each set of books. Six years separate the publishing of these duologies. Each story is so rich, I think it is hard to appreciate if you read all four books in one go. Yet, the narrative is so compelling it might be hard to resist. I waited about one year between reading the original <em>Cantos</em> and this follow up and I was glad I did.</p>\n\n<p>Set 272 years after the events of the original books, <em>Endymion</em> and <em>The Rise of Endymion</em> serve as crucial stories that satisfyingly close loops I did not even realize were open at the end of the originals. What was once a glimpse at future worlds and great cosmic powers now unfurl as major players, their primary motivations unveiled.</p>\n\n<p>These books are so entwined with the original that I will not say anything about its plot so that there are no spoilers. What I can offer is the following. Whereas books 1 and 2 play with story structure to captivating effect, these books do not. Instead, we are treated to a uniquely omniscient narrator, who is both truly omniscient and integral to the events of the story. How he gains this omniscience is a major plot point that&rsquo;s pulled off effortlessly. The first two books are framed as an epic poem, known as the <em>Hyperion Cantos</em>, written by one of the major characters in those events. Another thing we learn is the original <em>Cantos</em> is not entirely reliable. Their author, who as not omniscient, had to fill in some blanks to complete the story, and also failed to understand some of the &ldquo;heady&rdquo; aspects of what happened and was sloppy in their explanations. Thus, we are treated both to key future events and simultaneously charged with a new reading of the original novels as written by a less than reliable narrator. What is true and what is not will all be told in this excellent follow up.</p>\n\n<p>A word to the wise&ndash; Simmons may feel a bit &ldquo;mushy&rdquo; in his message for some &ldquo;hard&rdquo; science fiction readers. I think there is both profound depth and beautiful presentation of ideas, both complex enough to &ldquo;earn&rdquo; this treatment and some simpler than the story seems to warrant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-rook\">The Rook</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Rook-Novel-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316098809//?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20\">The Rook</a> is a fantastically fun debut novel<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:debuts\"><a href=\"#fn:debuts\">3</a></sup> written by an Australian bureaucrat. I learned about this book from one of my favorite podcasts, <a href=\"http://www.5by5.tv/incomparable\">The Incomparable</a>. <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/incomparable/128\">Episode 128: Bureaucracy was Her Superpower</a> is an excellent discussion that you should listen to after reading this book. I feel the hosts of that show captured perfectly what made this book great&ndash; it was completely honest and fair to its reader.</p>\n\n<p>It is not giving anything away to say that The Rook centers around a Myfanwy (mispronounced even by the main character as <em>Miffany</em>, like <em>Tiffany</em> with an M) who suddenly becomes aware of her troublesome surroundings but with complete amnesia. It would be easy to dismiss the memory loss as a trite plot driver, used as a cheap way to trick our characters and readers. But O&rsquo;Malley is brilliant in his use of Myfanwy&rsquo;s memory loss. This book does not lie to its reader or its characters. Memory loss does not conceal some simple literary irony. Instead, it serves to create a fascinating experience for a reader who learns to understand and love a character as she creates, understands, and learns to love herself.</p>\n\n<p>Myfanwy is not just an ordinary young woman with memory loss. She&rsquo;s a high ranking official in what can best be described as the British X-Men who run MI-5. And she knew her memory loss was imminent. As such, she prepared letters for her future, new self to learn all about her life and her attempts to uncover the plot that would lead to her own memory loss. Again, the letters could be seen as cheap opportunities for exposition and to create false tension, but O&rsquo;Malley never holds too tight to their use as a structure. We read more letters at the beginning of the story, and fewer later on as the reader is availed of facts and back story as they become relevant, without a poorly orchestrated attempt to withhold information from the main character. Instead of assuming Myfanwy is reading along with us, we easily slip into an understanding that shortly after our story begins, Myfanwy actually takes the time to read all the letters and we, thankfully, are not dragged along for the ride blow by blow.</p>\n\n<p>The Rook manages to tread space in both story and structure that should feel wholly unoriginal and formulaic but never becoming either.

				"content_text": "\nThis summer has been very productive for my fiction reading backlog. Here are just some of the things I have read since Memorial Day. [^affiliatescum]\n\n[^affiliatescum]: Affiliate links throughout, if that kind of thing bugs you. If that kind of thing does bug you, could you shoot me an email and explain why? I admit to not getting all the *rage* around affiliate linking.\n\n## Novels\n\n### The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss\n\nI picked up [The Name of the Wind](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0756405890/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) on a whim while cruising through the bookstore. I was glad I did. This book tells a classic story-- a precocious young wizard learns to use his powers, building toward being the most important person in the world. The book is framed around an innkeeper and his apprentice who are more than they seem. When a man claiming to be the most famous storyteller in the land enters the inn, we learn that our innkeeper has past filled with spectacular exploits that our bard wants to record. Lucky for our reader, Kvothe, in addition to be a warrior-wizard of extraordinary talent, is a narcissist who decides to tell his whole story just this once to this most famous of all chroniclers. [^narcissist] Although I have spoken to several folks who found Kvothe to be utterly unlikeable because of both his sly form of arrogance and Rothfuss's decision to seemingly make Kvothe worthy of such high self-worth, I loved this book. \n\n[^narcissist]: Learning more about our main character, I am somewhat dubious that this is the only time he has told of his exploits, although this older Kvothe may have become a lot less inclined to boasting.\n\nIn this first book of the *The Kingkiller Chronicle* (as these things tend to be named), we learn all about Kvothe's formative years. We spend substantial time exploring dark times in Kvothe's life when he endures tragedy, trauma, and horrible poverty before finally beginning to learn how to truly use his talents. It is a fair critique that Kvothe seems almost \"too good\", but much of the story is about how skill, luck, and folly all contribute to his success and fame, much of which is based on exaggerated tellings of true events.\n\nIf you are a fan of this sort of fantasy, with magic, destiny, love, power, and coming of age, I recommend picking up this book. Rothfuss has a gift. The sequel, [The Wise Man's Fear](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0756407915/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) is already available, and I will certainly be reading it before the end of the summer.\n\n### Endymion and The Rise of Endymion by Dan Simmons\n\n[Endymion](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553572946/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) and [The Rise of Endymion](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553572989/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) are the must anticipated (15 years ago) follow up to Dan Simmons's brilliant [Hyperion](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553283685/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) and [Fall of Hyperion](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553288202/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20). I strongly recommend the originals, which is one of the greatest tales in all of science fiction. I also recommend creating some distance between reading each set of books. Six years separate the publishing of these duologies. Each story is so rich, I think it is hard to appreciate if you read all four books in one go. Yet, the narrative is so compelling it might be hard to resist. I waited about one year between reading the original *Cantos* and this follow up and I was glad I did.\n\nSet 272 years after the events of the original books, *Endymion* and *The Rise of Endymion* serve as crucial stories that satisfyingly close loops I did not even realize were open at the end of the originals. What was once a glimpse at future worlds and great cosmic powers now unfurl as major players, their primary motivations unveiled. \n\nThese books are so entwined with the original that I will not say anything about its plot so that there are no spoilers. What I can offer is the following. Whereas books 1 and 2 play with story structure to captivating effect, these books do not. Instead, we are treated to a uniquely omniscient narrator, who is both truly omniscient and integral to the events of the story. How he gains this omniscience is a major plot point that's pulled off effortlessly. The first two books are framed as an epic poem, known as the *Hyperion Cantos*, written by one of the major characters in those events. Another thing we learn is the original *Cantos* is not entirely reliable. Their author, who as not omniscient, had to fill in some blanks to complete the story, and also failed to understand some of the \"heady\" aspects of what happened and was sloppy in their explanations. Thus, we are treated both to key future events and simultaneously charged with a new reading of the original novels as written by a less than reliable narrator. What is true and what is not will all be told in this excellent follow up.\n\nA word to the wise-- Simmons may feel a bit \"mushy\" in his message for some \"hard\" science fiction readers. I think there is both profound depth and beautiful presentation of ideas, both complex enough to \"earn\" this treatment and some simpler than the story seems to warrant.\n\n### The Rook\n[The Rook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rook-Novel-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316098809//?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) is a fantastically fun debut novel[^debuts] written by an Australian bureaucrat. I learned about this book from one of my favorite podcasts, [The Incomparable](http://www.5by5.tv/incomparable). [Episode 128: Bureaucracy was Her Superpower](http://5by5.tv/incomparable/128) is an excellent discussion that you should listen to after reading this book. I feel the hosts of that show captured perfectly what made this book great-- it was completely honest and fair to its reader.\n\n[^debuts]: Actually, The Rook is the second debut on this list. The Name of the Wind was Rothfuss's first.\n\nIt is not giving anything away to say that The Rook centers around a Myfanwy (mispronounced even by the main character as *Miffany*, like *Tiffany* with an M) who suddenly becomes aware of her troublesome surroundings but with complete amnesia. It would be easy to dismiss the memory loss as a trite plot driver, used as a cheap way to trick our characters and readers. But O'Malley is brilliant in his use of Myfanwy's memory loss. This book does not lie to its reader or its characters. Memory loss does not conceal some simple literary irony. Instead, it serves to create a fascinating experience for a reader who learns to understand and love a character as she creates, understands, and learns to love herself.\n\nMyfanwy is not just an ordinary young woman with memory loss. She's a high ranking official in what can best be described as the British X-Men who run MI-5. And she knew her memory loss was imminent. As such, she prepared letters for her future, new self to learn all about her life and her attempts to uncover the plot that would lead to her own memory loss. Again, the letters could be seen as cheap opportunities for exposition and to create false tension, but O'Malley never holds too tight to their use as a structure. We read more letters at the beginning of the story, and fewer later on as the reader is availed of facts and back story as they become relevant, without a poorly orchestrated attempt to withhold information from the main character. Instead of assuming Myfanwy is reading along with us, we easily slip into an understanding that shortly after our story begins, Myfanwy actually takes the time to read all the letters and we, thankfully, are not dragged along for the ride blow by blow.\n\nThe Rook manages to tread space in both story and structure that should feel wholly unoriginal and formulaic but never becoming either. The powers of the various individuals are fascinating, original, and consequential. The structure of the book is additive, but the plot itself is not dependent on its machinations. \n\nMost of all, The Rook is completely fun and totally satisfying. That's not something we say often in a post-Sopranos, post-Batman Begins world.\n\n### The Ocean at the End of the Lane\nSpeaking of delightful, Neil Gaiman is at his best with [The Ocean at the End of the Lane](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062255657/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20). Gaiman is the master of childhood, which is where I think he draws his power as a fantasy writer. He is able to so capture the imagination of a child in beautiful prose it is as thought I am transformed into an 8-year old boy reading by flashlight in bed late at night, anxious and frightened.\n\nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane is a beautiful, dark fairy tale. Our narrator has recently experienced a loss in the family that has affected him profoundly, such that he is driven to detour back to the home he grew up in. Most of us can appreciate how deep sadness can drive us toward spending some time alone in a nostalgic place, both mentally and physically, as we work through our feelings.\n\nThere, we are greeted with the resurfacing of memories from childhood when events most unnatural conspired to do harm against him and his family. \n\nI really don't want to say much from this book except that it is heartbreakingly beautiful in a way that only someone like Gaiman can manage. This is a book that should be read in just one or two sittings. It is profoundly satisfying for anyone who loves to read books that transform who and where they are. Gaiman achieves this completely.\n\n## Comics\n\n### Locke and Key\nJoe Hill is a master of his craft. Over Memorial Day weekend there was a great Comixology sale that dramatically reduced the price of getting in on [Locke and Key](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1600102379/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) and I jumped right on board.\n\nI have rarely cared so much for a set of characters, regardless of the medium.\n\nOur main characters, the Locke family (three young children and their mother), are faced with tragedy in the very first panels of *Welcome to Lovecraft*, the opening volume of this six-part series. I think what makes Locke and Key unique is rather than use tragedy simply as the opportunity to produce heroism, our protagonists are faced with real, long lasting, deep, and horrifying consequences. \n\nAll the while, we are thrust into the fascinating world of Key House, the Locke family home where our main characters' father grew up. Key House is home to magical keys each of which can open one locked door. Step through that door, and there are fantastical consequences like dying, becoming a spirit free to float around the house until your spirit returns through the door. One door might bring great strength, another flight. \n\nIt is not surprising that the tragedy that drives the Locke family back to Key House is deeply connected to the mysterious home's history, and the very source of its magic. What is brilliant is how Joe Hill quietly reveals the greater plot through the every day misadventures of children who are dealing with a massive life change. These characters are rich, their world is fully realized, and the story is quite compelling. A must read.\n\nDon't believe me? The Incomparable strikes again with a [great episode](http://5by5.tv/incomparable/126) on the first volume of Locke and Key.\n\n### American Vampire\nI was turned on to [American Vampire](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1401229743/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20) by [Dan Benjamin](http://www.dansent.me). Wow. Phenomenal. These are real vampires.\n  \n### East of West\n\n### Saga\n\n\n",

Mr. Hiltonsmith has done a notable job explaining the differences between the new system and the old system.</p>\n\n<p>The brief, unfortunately, fails by engaging in two common fallacies to support its broader conclusions. The first is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man\">straw man fallacy</a>. Mr. Hiltonsmith takes a limited set of the objectives of the entire RIRSA legislation and says defined contribution plans do not meet those objectives. That is true, but ignores the other objectives it does accomplish which were also part of the motivation behind RIRSA. The second is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning\">circular reasoning</a>. In this case, Mr. Hiltonsmith states that the reason for a low funding ratio is because the state did not put 100% of its paper liability into the pension fund. This is a tautology and not in dispute and should not be trumpeted as a conclusion of analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Here are his three main points that he believes makes RIRSA a bad policy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The defined contribution plan does not save the state money from its annual pension contributions.</li>\n<li>The defined contribution plan is likely to earn lower returns and therefore result in lower benefits for retirees.</li>\n<li>The defined contribution plan does not solve the low funding ratio of the pension plan which exists because law makers did not make required contributions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, the defined contribution portion of RIRSA was not in place to do any of these three things. The purpose of including a defined contribution plan in the new state pension system is to create stability in annual budget allocations and avoid locking the government into promises it has demonstrated it fails to keep. Defined benefit plans require the state to change pension contributions when there are market fluctuations and leads to anti-cyclical costs, where the state is forced to put substantially more resources into pensions when revenues are lowest and spending on social welfare is most important. The defined contribution plan keeps the payments required by the state consistent and highly predictable. This is far preferable from a budget perspective.</p>\n\n<p>It is unfortunate that there are lower returns to defined contribution plans which may lead to a decrease in overall benefits. It is my opinion that the unions in Rhode Island should be pushing for a substantially better match on the defined contribution portion of their plan that more closely resembles private sector match rates. This could more than alleviate the difference in benefits while maintaining the predictability, for budgeting purposes, of the defined contribution plan. I doubt this policy would have much hope of passing while Rhode Island slowly crawls out of a deep recession, but it is certainly a reasonable matter for future legislatures.</p>\n\n<p>There are only two ways to decrease the current pension fund shortfalls: increase payments to the fund or decrease benefits. There is no structural magic sauce to get around this. Structural changes in the pension system are aimed at reducing the likelihood that the state will reproduce its current situation, with liabilities well outstripping funds. It is true that the &ldquo;savings&rdquo; largely came from cutting benefits. I have not heard anyone claim otherwise. The only alternative was to put a big lump sum into the pension fund. That clearly was not a part of RIRSA.</p>\n\n<p>It is absurd to judge RIRSA on the ability of defined contribution plans to achieve policy objectives that are unrelated to the purpose of this structural change.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most troubling conclusion of this brief was that,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The shortfall in Rhode Island&rsquo;s pension plan for public employees is largely due not to overly generous benefits, but to the failure of state and local government employers to pay their required share of pensions&rsquo; cost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I read that and expected to see evidence of skipped payments or a discussion of overly ambitious expectations for investment returns, etc. Instead, it seems that this conclusion is based simply on the fact that the benefits in Rhode Island were not deemed outrageously large, and therefore Rhode Island should just pay the liability hole. The &ldquo;failure&rdquo; here is predicated entirely on the idea that the pensions as offered should be met, period, whatever the cost to the government. This is the &ldquo;required share&rdquo;. Which, of course, is technically true without a change in the law, but feels disingenuous. It is essentially a wholesale agreement with the union interpretation of the state pension system as an immutable contract. The courts will likely resolve whether or not this is true. My objection is that Mr. Hiltonsmith makes a definitive statement on this rationale without describing it. In such a lucid description of how the retirement system has changed, it seems this could only be intentional omission intended to support a predetermined conclusion rather than illuminate the unconvinced.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Hiltonsmith also claims that, &ldquo;Over the long term, RIRSA may cost the state upwards of \\$15 million a year in additional contributions while providing a smaller benefit for the average full-career worker.&rdquo; I am not 100% certain, but based on his use of the normal cost <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:normal-cost\"><a href=\"#fn:normal-cost\">1</a></sup> to do these calculations, it appears this conclusion is drawn only based on the marginal contributions to current employees. In other words, if we <em>completely ignore</em> the existing liability, the new plan cost the state more money marginally while potentially decreasing benefits for employees. It is my opinion that Mr. Hiltonsmith is intentionally creating the perception that RIRSA costs more than the current plan while providing fewer benefits.

				"content_html": "<p>Apple will be revealing new details for both of its major operating systems at WWDC on June 10, 2013. The focus of much speculation has been how Apple will improve multi-tasking and inter-app communication in iOS7. As batteries have grown, CPUs have become increasingly powerful, and the application <a href=\"|filename|frictionless.md\">ecosystem</a> has matured <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:viticci\"><a href=\"#fn:viticci\">1</a></sup>, the iOS sandboxing model has felt increasingly limiting and outdated.</p>\n\n<p>I think that there is a simple change that could dramatically increase the effectiveness of multitasking on iOS by re-examining how application switching works.</p>\n\n<p>Scrolling through a long list of applications, either through the basement shelf or via the four-finger gesture on an iPad, is both slow and lacking in contextual cues. In a simple case where I am working with two applications simultaneously, how do I switch between them? The list of open applications always places the current application in the first position. The previously used application sits in the second position. The first time I want to change to another application this is not so bad. I move to the &ldquo;right&rdquo; on the list to progress forward into the next application <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:next\"><a href=\"#fn:next\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble comes when I want to return to where I was just working. The most natural mental model for this switch is to move &ldquo;left&rdquo; in the list. I moved &ldquo;right&rdquo; to get here and millions of years of evolution has taught me the the &ldquo;undo button&rdquo; for moving right is to move left <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:inform7\"><a href=\"#fn:inform7\">3</a></sup>. But of course, when I attempt to move &ldquo;left&rdquo;, I find no destination <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:youcant\"><a href=\"#fn:youcant\">4</a></sup>. I can pop an application from anywhere on the list, but I can only prepend new applications to the list <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:ignorant\"><a href=\"#fn:ignorant\">5</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Apple needs to move away from its linear thinking and enter the second dimension.</p>\n\n<p>What if I could drag apps in the switcher on top of each other to make a new stack, not unlike the option on the OS X launch bar? Throughout this stack, position is maintained regardless of which application is in use/was last used. I can always move <strong>up</strong> from Chrome to ByWord, and <strong>down</strong> to Good Reader, for example, if I was writing a report. Apple might call this a Stack, mirroring the term in OSX, but I would prefer this to be called a <em>Flow</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this feature is to organize a <em>Flow</em> for a particular task that requires using multiple apps. One feature might be saving a &ldquo;Flow&rdquo;, this way each time I want to write a blog post, I tap the same home screen button and the same four apps in the same order launch in a <em>Flow</em>, ready for easy switching using the familiar four-finger swipe gesture up and down. I no longer have to worry about the sequence I have recently accessed applications which is confusing and requires me to look at the app switcher draw or needlessly and repeatedly swipe through applications. I never have to worry about lingering too long on one application while swiping through and switching to that app, changing my position to the origin of the list and starting over again.</p>\n\n<p>For all the calls for complex inter-app communication or having multiple apps active on the screen at the same time, it seems a simple interface change to application switching could complete change the way we multitask on iOS.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:viticci\">And Federico Viticci has either shown us the light or gone completely mad.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:viticci\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:next\">For now, lets assume the right application is next in the stack.

				"content_text": "\nApple will be revealing new details for both of its major operating systems at WWDC on June 10, 2013. The focus of much speculation has been how Apple will improve multi-tasking and inter-app communication in iOS7. As batteries have grown, CPUs have become increasingly powerful, and the application [ecosystem][] has matured [^viticci], the iOS sandboxing model has felt increasingly limiting and outdated.\n\nI think that there is a simple change that could dramatically increase the effectiveness of multitasking on iOS by re-examining how application switching works.\n\nScrolling through a long list of applications, either through the basement shelf or via the four-finger gesture on an iPad, is both slow and lacking in contextual cues. In a simple case where I am working with two applications simultaneously, how do I switch between them? The list of open applications always places the current application in the first position. The previously used application sits in the second position. The first time I want to change to another application this is not so bad. I move to the \"right\" on the list to progress forward into the next application [^next]. \n\nThe trouble comes when I want to return to where I was just working. The most natural mental model for this switch is to move \"left\" in the list. I moved \"right\" to get here and millions of years of evolution has taught me the the \"undo button\" for moving right is to move left [^inform7]. But of course, when I attempt to move \"left\", I find no destination [^youcant]. I can pop an application from anywhere on the list, but I can only prepend new applications to the list [^ignorant].\n\nApple needs to move away from its linear thinking and enter the second dimension.\n\nWhat if I could drag apps in the switcher on top of each other to make a new stack, not unlike the option on the OS X launch bar? Throughout this stack, position is maintained regardless of which application is in use/was last used. I can always move **up** from Chrome to ByWord, and **down** to Good Reader, for example, if I was writing a report. Apple might call this a Stack, mirroring the term in OSX, but I would prefer this to be called a *Flow*.\n\nThe goal of this feature is to organize a *Flow* for a particular task that requires using multiple apps. One feature might be saving a \"Flow\", this way each time I want to write a blog post, I tap the same home screen button and the same four apps in the same order launch in a *Flow*, ready for easy switching using the familiar four-finger swipe gesture up and down. I no longer have to worry about the sequence I have recently accessed applications which is confusing and requires me to look at the app switcher draw or needlessly and repeatedly swipe through applications. I never have to worry about lingering too long on one application while swiping through and switching to that app, changing my position to the origin of the list and starting over again. \n\nFor all the calls for complex inter-app communication or having multiple apps active on the screen at the same time, it seems a simple interface change to application switching could complete change the way we multitask on iOS.\n\n[ecosystem]: |filename|frictionless.md\n\n[^viticci]: And Federico Viticci has either shown us the light or gone completely mad.\n\n[^next]: For now, lets assume the right application is next in the stack. I'll get to that issue with my second change.\n\n[^inform7]: `You are in a green room. > Go east. You are in a red room. > Go west. You are in a green room.`\n\n[^youcant]: `You can't go that way.`\n\n[^ignorant]: I don't know enough about data structures yet to name what's going on here. I am tempted to think that the challenge is they have presented a list to users, with a decidedly horizontal metaphor, when they actually have created something more akin to a stack, with a decidedly vertical metaphor. But a stack isn't quite the right way to understand the app switcher. You can \"pop\" an app from any arbitrary position on the app switcher, but funny enough can only push a new app on to the top of the switcher.\n",

My needs are simple. I like control. I am a geek. And I really need an excuse to learn Python, which seems to be rapidly growing into one of the most important programming languages for a data analyst.</p>\n\n<p>I have decided to migrate this blog over to <a href=\"http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/\">Pelican</a>, a static site generator written in Python. Static sites are the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; way to do a webpage&ndash; just upload a bunch of HTML and CSS files, maybe some Javascript. But no databases and no constructing the page a user sees in the browser as they request it. This puts substantially less strain on a web server and makes it far easier to export and move a webpage since all you need to do is duplicate files. What makes static sites a real pain is that there is a lot of repetition. Folks adopted dynamic sites that use content management system so that they can write a page called &ldquo;post.php&rdquo; one time, and for each unique post just query a database for the unique content. The frame around the post, layout, components, etc are all just written once. Static site generators allow you to build a webpage using a similar, but far more stripped down, layout system. However, rather than generate each page on the web server, you generate each page by running a script locally that transforms plain text documents into well-formed HTML/CSS. Then you can just upload a directory and the whole site is ready to go.</p>\n\n<p>Pelican comes with a pretty good script that will take Wordpress XML that&rsquo;s available via the built-in export tools and transform each post into a <a href=\"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\">reStructuredText</a> files, a format similar to <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a>. I prefer Markdown so I used <a href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\">pandoc</a> to convert all my *.rst posts into *.md files.</p>\n\n<p>So far, so good.</p>\n\n<p>But one of the really big problems I had with Wordpress was a growing dependency on plugins that added non-standard, text-based markup in my posts that would be rendered a particular way. For example, text surrounded by two parenthesis, &lsquo;[^0]&lsquo;, became a footnote. For code syntax highlighting, I use a &ldquo;short code&rdquo;, which puts &ldquo;sourcecode language=&lsquo;r&rsquo;&rdquo;, for example, between brackets []. All of these plugins have been great, but now when you try to export a post you get the non-standard markup in-line as part of your posts. It makes it very difficult to recreate a post the way it looks today.</p>\n\n<p>This presents a great opportunity to learn a little Python. So I have begun to scrounge together some basic Python knowledge to write some scripts to clean up my Markdown files and convert the syntax of the short codes that I have used to properly formatted Markdown so that when I run the pelican script it will accurately reproduce each post.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve hit a snag with my very first attempt. Footnotes are a big deal to me and have standard Markdown interpretation. In Markdown, footnotes are inserted in the text where &ldquo;[\\^#]&rdquo; appears in the text, where # = the footnote identifier/key. Then, at the end of the document, surrounded by new lines, the footnote text is found with &ldquo;[\\^#]: footnote text&rdquo; where # is the same identifier. So I needed to write a script that found each instance of text surrounded by two parentheses, insert the [\\^#] part in place of the footnote, and then add the footnote at the bottom of the post in the right format.</p>\n\n<p>I created a test text file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:::\nThis is a test ((test footnote)).\nAnd here is another test ((footnote2)). Why not add a third? ((Three\nThree)).\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The goal was to end up with a file like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:::\nThis is a test [^1]. And here is another\ntest [^2]. Why not add a third? [^3].\n\n[^1]: test footnote\n\n[^2]: footnote2\n\n[^3]: Three Three\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the output isn&rsquo;t quite right. My best attempt resulted in\na file like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:::\nThis is a test [^1] And here is another te[^2])). Why not add a\nt[^3]ree)).\n\n[^1]: ((test footnote))\n\n[^2]: ((footnote2))\n\n[^3]: ((Three Three))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ugh.</p>\n\n<p>So I am turning to the tiny slice of my readership that might actually know Python or just code in general to help me out. Where did I screw up? The source to my Python script is below so feel free to comment here or on this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/4342554#file-wpfootnotestomarkdown-py\">Gist</a>. I am particularly frustrate that the regex appears to be capturing the parenthesis, because that&rsquo;s not how the same code behaves on <a href=\"http://www.pythonregex.com\">PythonRegex.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone can help me with the next step, which will be creating arguments that will understand an input like *.rst and set the output to creating a file that&rsquo;s *.md, that would be appreciated as well.</p>\n\n<pre><code>:::python\nimport re\n\np = re.compile(&quot;\\(\\(([^\\(\\(\\)\\)]+)\\)\\)&quot;)\nfile_path = str(raw_input('File Name &gt;'))\ntext = open(file_path).read()\n\nfootnoteMatches = p.finditer(text)\n\ncoordinates = []\nfootnotes = []\n\n# Print span of matches\nfor match in footnoteMatches:\n    coordinates.append(match.span())\n    footnotes.append(match.group())\n\nfor i in range(0,len(coordinates)):\n    text = (text[0:coordinates[i][0]] + '[^' + str(i+1)+ ']' +\n            text[coordinates[i][1]+1:])\n    shift = coordinates[i][1] - coordinates[i][0]\n    j = i + 1\n    while j &lt; len(coordinates):\n        coordinates[j] = (coordinates[j][0] - shift, coordinates[j][1] - shift)\n        j += 1\n\nreferenceLinkList = [text 1=&quot;'\n'&quot; language=&quot;,&quot;][/text]\nfor i in range(0, len(footnotes)):\n    insertList = ''.join(['\\n', '[^', str(i+1), ']: ', footnotes[i], '\\n'])\n    referenceLinkList.append(insertList)\n\ntext = ''.join(referenceLinkList)\n\nnewFile = open(file_path, 'w')\nnewFile.truncate()\nnewFile.write(text)\nnewFile.close()\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"update-with-solutions\">Update with solutions:</h2>\n\n<p>I am happy to report I now have two working solutions. The first one comes courtesy of <a href=\"https://github.com/ilikepi\">James Blanding</a> who was kind enough to <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/4355865\">fork</a> the gist I put up. While I was hoping to take a look tonight at his fork tonight, <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4957935\">Github was experiencing some downtime</a>.  So I ended up fixing the script myself a slightly different way (seen below). I think James&rsquo;s approach is superior for a few reasons, not the least of which was avoiding the ugly if/elif/else found in my code by using a global counter. He also used .format() a lot better than I did, which I didn&rsquo;t know existed until I found it tonight.</p>\n\n<p>I made two other changes before coming to my solution. First, I realized my regex was completely wrong. I didn&rsquo;t want to capture anything within the two parenthesis when no parenthesis were contained, as the original regex did. Instead, I wanted to make sure to preserve any parenthetical comments contained within my footnotes. So the resulting regex looks a bit different. I also switched from using user input to taking in the filepath as an argument.</p>\n\n<p>My next step will be to learn a bit more about the os module which seems to contain what I need so that this Python script can behave like a good Unix script and know what to do with one file or a list of files as a parameter (and of course, most importantly, a list generated from a wild card like *.rst). I will also be incorporating the bits of James&rsquo;s code that I feel confident I understand and that I like better.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, my solution (I updated the gist as well):</p>\n\n<pre><code>:::python\nfrom sys import argv\nimport re\n\nname, file_path = argv\n\np = re.compile(r&quot;[\\s]\\(\\((.*?[)]{0,1})\\)\\)[\\s]{0,1}&quot;)\n# The tricky part here is to match all text between &quot;((&quot;&quot;))&quot;, including as \n# many as one set of (), which may even terminate ))). The {0,1} captures as\n# many as one ). The trailing space is there because I often surrounded the \n# &quot;((&quot;&quot;))&quot; with a space to make it clear in the WordPress editor.\n\n# file_path = str(raw_input('File Name &gt;'))\ntext = open(file_path).read()\n\nfootnoteMatches = p.finditer(text)\n\ncoordinates = []\nfootnotes = []\n\n# Print span of matches\nfor match in footnoteMatches:\n    coordinates.append(match.span())\n# Capture only group(1) so you get the content of the footnote, not the \n# whole pattern which includes the parenthesis delimiter.\n    footnotes.append(match.group(1))\n\nnewText = []\nfor i in range(0, len(coordinates)):\n    if i == 0:\n        newText.append(''.join(text[:coordinates[i][0]] +\n                               ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))\n    elif i &lt; len(coordinates) - 1 :\n        newText.append(''.join(text[coordinates[i-1][1]:coordinates[i][0]] +\n                          ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))\n    else:\n        newText.append(''.join(text[coordinates[i-1][1]:coordinates[i][0]] +\n                          ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))\n        # Accounts for text after the last footnote which only runs once.\n        newText.append(text[coordinates[i][1]:]+'\\n')\n\nendNotes = []\nfor j in range(0, len(footnotes)):\n    insertList = ''.join(['\\n','[^{}]: ', footnotes[j], '\\n']).format(j + 1)\n    endNotes.append(insertList)\n\nnewText = ''.join(newText) + '\\n' + ''.join(endNotes)\n\nnewFile = open(file_path, 'w')\nnewFile.truncate()\nnewFile.write(newText)\nnewFile.close()\n</code></pre>\n",

I am particularly frustrate that the regex appears to be capturing the parenthesis, because that's not how the same code behaves on [PythonRegex.com][].\n\nIf anyone can help me with the next step, which will be creating arguments that will understand an input like *.rst and set the output to creating a file that's *.md, that would be appreciated as well. \n\n    :::python\n    import re\n    \n    p = re.compile(\"\\(\\(([^\\(\\(\\)\\)]+)\\)\\)\")\n    file_path = str(raw_input('File Name >'))\n    text = open(file_path).read()\n    \n    footnoteMatches = p.finditer(text)\n    \n    coordinates = []\n    footnotes = []\n    \n    # Print span of matches\n    for match in footnoteMatches:\n        coordinates.append(match.span())\n        footnotes.append(match.group())\n    \n    for i in range(0,len(coordinates)):\n        text = (text[0:coordinates[i][0]] + '[^' + str(i+1)+ ']' +\n                text[coordinates[i][1]+1:])\n        shift = coordinates[i][1] - coordinates[i][0]\n        j = i + 1\n        while j < len(coordinates):\n            coordinates[j] = (coordinates[j][0] - shift, coordinates[j][1] - shift)\n            j += 1\n    \n    referenceLinkList = [text 1=\"'\n    '\" language=\",\"][/text]\n    for i in range(0, len(footnotes)):\n        insertList = ''.join(['\\n', '[^', str(i+1), ']: ', footnotes[i], '\\n'])\n        referenceLinkList.append(insertList)\n    \n    text = ''.join(referenceLinkList)\n    \n    newFile = open(file_path, 'w')\n    newFile.truncate()\n    newFile.write(text)\n    newFile.close()\n\n## Update with solutions:\n\nI am happy to report I now have two working solutions. The first one comes courtesy of [James Blanding][] who was kind enough to [fork][] the gist I put up. While I was hoping to take a look tonight at his fork tonight, [Github was experiencing some downtime][].  So I ended up fixing the script myself a slightly different way (seen below). I think James's approach is superior for a few reasons, not the least of which was avoiding the ugly if/elif/else found in my code by using a global counter. He also used .format() a lot better than I did, which I didn't know existed until I found it tonight.\n\nI made two other changes before coming to my solution. First, I realized my regex was completely wrong. I didn't want to capture anything within the two parenthesis when no parenthesis were contained, as the original regex did. Instead, I wanted to make sure to preserve any parenthetical comments contained within my footnotes. So the resulting regex looks a bit different. I also switched from using user input to taking in the filepath as an argument.\n\nMy next step will be to learn a bit more about the os module which seems to contain what I need so that this Python script can behave like a good Unix script and know what to do with one file or a list of files as a parameter (and of course, most importantly, a list generated from a wild card like \\*.rst). I will also be incorporating the bits of James's code that I feel confident I understand and that I like better.\n\nWithout further ado, my solution (I updated the gist as well):\n\n    :::python\n    from sys import argv\n    import re\n    \n    name, file_path = argv\n    \n    p = re.compile(r\"[\\s]\\(\\((.*?[)]{0,1})\\)\\)[\\s]{0,1}\")\n    # The tricky part here is to match all text between \"((\"\"))\", including as \n    # many as one set of (), which may even terminate ))). The {0,1} captures as\n    # many as one ). The trailing space is there because I often surrounded the \n    # \"((\"\"))\" with a space to make it clear in the WordPress editor.\n    \n    # file_path = str(raw_input('File Name >'))\n    text = open(file_path).read()\n    \n    footnoteMatches = p.finditer(text)\n    \n    coordinates = []\n    footnotes = []\n    \n    # Print span of matches\n    for match in footnoteMatches:\n        coordinates.append(match.span())\n    # Capture only group(1) so you get the content of the footnote, not the \n    # whole pattern which includes the parenthesis delimiter.\n        footnotes.append(match.group(1))\n    \n    newText = []\n    for i in range(0, len(coordinates)):\n        if i == 0:\n            newText.append(''.join(text[:coordinates[i][0]] +\n                                   ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))\n        elif i < len(coordinates) - 1 :\n            newText.append(''.join(text[coordinates[i-1][1]:coordinates[i][0]] +\n                              ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))\n        else:\n            newText.append(''.join(text[coordinates[i-1][1]:coordinates[i][0]] +\n                              ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))\n            # Accounts for text after the last footnote which only runs once.\n            newText.append(text[coordinates[i][1]:]+'\\n')\n    \n    endNotes = []\n    for j in range(0, len(footnotes)):\n        insertList = ''.join(['\\n','[^{}]: ', footnotes[j], '\\n']).format(j + 1)\n        endNotes.append(insertList)\n    \n    newText = ''.join(newText) + '\\n' + ''.join(endNotes)\n    \n    newFile = open(file_path, 'w')\n    newFile.truncate()\n    newFile.write(newText)\n    newFile.close()\n\n\n[Pelican]: http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/\n[reStructuredText]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\n[Markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n[pandoc]: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\n[Gist]: https://gist.github.com/4342554#file-wpfootnotestomarkdown-py\n[PythonRegex.com]: http://www.pythonregex.com\n[James Blanding]: https://github.com/ilikepi\n[fork]: https://gist.github.com/4355865\n[Github was experiencing some downtime]: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4957935\n\n",

I have, however, read Paul Tough&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/what-if-the-secret-to-success-is-failure.html\">New York Times Magazine article on grit</a> and recently listened to an <a href=\"http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/09/paul_tough_on_h.html\">EconTalk podcast</a> where he discussed <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How Children Succeed</span>.</p>\n\n<p>The thrust of Tough&rsquo;s argument, if I were to be so bold, is that there is a definable set of non-cognitive skills, called &ldquo;grit&rdquo;, that are at least as important as academic achievement in determining long-term positive outcomes for kids. Great schools, therefore, would do well to focus on developing these habits as much and as intentionally as they do developing content knowledge and academic prowess. This, according to Tough, is a big part of the &ldquo;magic sauce&rdquo;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>of &ldquo;No Excuses&rdquo; schools like KIPP. They teach &ldquo;grit&rdquo; as a part of their intense behavioral management and culture efforts.</p>\n\n<p>I think Tough is an engaging writer and has a great knack for finding some of the most interesting research not often read in education policy circles, but which is clearly relevant. While listening to the EconLog podcast I found myself often disagreeing with his interpretations/conclusions. But more often, I found myself desperately wishing for a different, slower format because so much of this work begged deeper questioning and conversation. What better reason could there be to buy and read a book-length treatment of these ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I thought I&rsquo;d share just a few of my thoughts on &ldquo;grit&rdquo; based on this interview and the earlier New York Times Magazine piece.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"teaching-conscientiousness-in-a-society-that-has-been-so-unconscientious\">Teaching conscientiousness in a society that has been so unconscientious</h2>\n\n<p>It seems fairly obvious that people who don&rsquo;t &ldquo;play by the rules&rdquo; and aren&rsquo;t easily motivated to conform to certain habits are less likely to be successful. It is unsurprising that Tough finds research that suggests that there is a &ldquo;grit&rdquo; gap between rich and poor. I want to know more about why, and I have, what I hope, is one interesting idea of what contributes to the &ldquo;grit gap&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that deterioration of the built environment, especially among the urban and truly rural poor, is a major contributor to low grit. Some parts of this country with high concentrations of poverty look&ndash; bombed out. Roads are littered with deep potholes and scars. The houses have chipped paint, rotting wood exterior elements, and unkept yards. Storefronts were built decades ago on the cheap, aged poorly, and were never updated. Their schools lack good lighting, decent HVAC systems, and functioning toilets. There is no pride found in any of these spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Children growing up in poverty do not see neighbors obsessing over their lawn. They do not watch one house after another repaint and reface their exteriors to ensure they weren&rsquo;t the ugliest house on the block. They do not see brand new cars, fresh asphalt roads, and schools that resemble palaces. I don&rsquo;t think virtually any of this has to do with the people who live in these neighborhoods. I do think it reflects the pathetic state that society has deemed acceptable, so long as it remains sight unseen by those with resources.</p>\n\n<p>Growing up in poverty often means being surrounded by spaces that society has left to rot. How can these children learn conscientiousness when the privileged have been so unconscientious?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-m-m-study\">The M&amp;M Study</h2>\n\n<p>Tough mentions <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1310767/\">a study</a> where students first take an IQ test under normal conditions. These same students are then given an IQ test but are rewarded with an M&amp;M each time they get a question right. This tiny immediate incentive resulted in a massive, 1.8SD improvement in mean IQ. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:0\"><a href=\"#fn:0\">3</a></sup> The implications are fascinating. It demonstrates the importance of motivation even while taking a test that is supposedly measuring an intractable, permanent attribute people have. This seems obvious and is fairly well known, but forgotten in many policy circles. I have often lamented that the New England Common Assessment Program has a sizable downward bias when measuring achievement because the exam is low stakes for students. The dramatic decrease in performance observed on the 11th grade NECAP math exam is almost certainly in part due to lower intrinsic motivation amongst high school students compared to their 8th grade and younger selves.</p>\n\n<p>There are some students that have no measurable response to the M&amp;M incentive. These students are exhibiting qualities of Tough&rsquo;s &ldquo;grit&rdquo;, conscientiousness that leads one to do well simply because they are being measured, or perhaps because there is no reason to do something if it is not going to be done well. I believe that there is also a bias against schools with concentrated poverty because of an uneven distribution of &ldquo;grit&rdquo;&ndash; suburban middle to upper class students with college ambitions will likely be the students who will sit down and try hard on a test just because they are being measured whereas urban students living in poverty are far less likely to exert that same effort for an exercise with no immediate or clear long-term consequences.</p>\n\n<p>All of this would be pretty blasé were it not for the more distal outcomes observed. The group of students that did not respond to the M&amp;M incentives had significantly and practically better outcomes than those that responded to the incentive. I can&rsquo;t recall exactly which outcomes were a part of this study, but Tough cites several independent studies that measure a similar set of qualities and find far better outcomes with GPA, graduation from high school, post-secondary degree attainment, juvenile delinquency or adult criminal activity, and wages.</p>\n\n<p>Tough&rsquo;s interpretation of these results seems to <a href=\"http://blog.jasonpbecker.com/2012/09/19/thoughts-on-grading/\">mirror my feelings on grading</a>. Low stakes testing (or in this case, no-incentive testing) has omitted variable bias which leads to observing students who lack &ldquo;grit&rdquo; as lower achieving than they are. The test results are still excellent predictors of later success but lack validity as a pure measure of academic achievement. My complaint about grades that use behavior, attendance, and participation<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">4</a></sup>does not stem from their lack of validity at predicting later outcomes. These grades are excellent predictors of later outcomes. Rather, it stems from these grade conflating two very different qualities into a single measure, making it far more difficult to design appropriate interventions and supports that target individual needs.</p>\n\n<p>Tough seems thinks this means that high stakes placed on test scores over emphasizes one quality over the other when both are very important. I disagree. I feel that high stakes test scores recreate the M&amp;M incentive and leads to a better measure of academic ability. That is not to say that we don&rsquo;t need to cultivate and measure non-cognitive skills. It just means that trying to measure both at once<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">5</a></sup>results in less clear and actionable interpretations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"is-the-grit-problem-properly-described-as-a-failure-to-recognize-long-term-benefits\">Is the &ldquo;grit&rdquo; problem properly described as a failure to recognize long-term benefits?</h2>\n\n<p>Repeatedly both Tough and host Russ Roberts point to the need to provide students who lack grit more information on the long-term benefits of &ldquo;doing well&rdquo;. For example, Tough cites KIPP&rsquo;s posting of the economic benefits of a bachelor&rsquo;s degree on walls in the halls of their schools as a way to build grit. Somewhat left unsaid is the idea that grit-like behaviors may not describe some kind of &ldquo;intrinsic&rdquo; motivation, but instead represent an understanding of the long-term extrinsic benefits of certain actions. Grit really means understanding that, &ldquo;If I behave appropriately, I will gain the respect of this authority and earn greater autonomy/responsibility,&rdquo; or perhaps, &ldquo;Doing my homework each night will teach me good habits of work and help me to learn this academic material so I can succeed in college and get a better job.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Can grit really be just a heuristic developed to better respond to long-term incentives?</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure. I am equally unsure that the activities of a &ldquo;No Excuses&rdquo; school actually generate the long-term benefits of &ldquo;grit&rdquo;. If grit is a powerful heuristic to optimize long-term outcomes, how do we know that many short-term incentives that build behaviors toward academic success mean that students better respond to a broad set of long-term outcomes? Should we believe that behavior bucks/demerit systems, constant small corrections, repeatedly stating the goals of education and its benefits, and other KIPP-like culture-building strategies build a bend toward acting in ways that maximize long-term outcomes? Do students aspire to college because they have internalized its importance, or do the stack of short-term incentives build a desire for sprokets, wignuts, and widgets that just happened to be called a &ldquo;bachelor&rsquo;s degree&rdquo; in this case?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">I use &ldquo;grit&rdquo; a lot in this post.

It just means that trying to measure both at once[^4]results in less clear and actionable interpretations.\n\n## Is the \"grit\" problem properly described as a failure to recognize long-term benefits?\n\nRepeatedly both Tough and host Russ Roberts point to the need to provide students who lack grit more information on the long-term benefits of \"doing well\". For example, Tough cites KIPP's posting of the economic benefits of a bachelor's degree on walls in the halls of their schools as a way to build grit. Somewhat left unsaid is the idea that grit-like behaviors may not describe some kind of \"intrinsic\" motivation, but instead represent an understanding of the long-term extrinsic benefits of certain actions. Grit really means understanding that, \"If I behave appropriately, I will gain the respect of this authority and earn greater autonomy/responsibility,\" or perhaps, \"Doing my homework each night will teach me good habits of work and help me to learn this academic material so I can succeed in college and get a better job.\"\n\nCan grit really be just a heuristic developed to better respond to long-term incentives?\n\nI am not sure. I am equally unsure that the activities of a \"No Excuses\" school actually generate the long-term benefits of \"grit\". If grit is a powerful heuristic to optimize long-term outcomes, how do we know that many short-term incentives that build behaviors toward academic success mean that students better respond to a broad set of long-term outcomes? Should we believe that behavior bucks/demerit systems, constant small corrections, repeatedly stating the goals of education and its benefits, and other KIPP-like culture-building strategies build a bend toward acting in ways that maximize long-term outcomes? Do students aspire to college because they have internalized its importance, or do the stack of short-term incentives build a desire for sprokets, wignuts, and widgets that just happened to be called a \"bachelor's degree\" in this case?\n\n[Paul Tough's newest book]: http://www.paultough.com/the-books/how-children-succeed/\n[New York Times Magazine article on grit]: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/what-if-the-secret-to-success-is-failure.html\n[EconTalk podcast]: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/09/paul_tough_on_h.html\n[a study]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1310767/\n[mirror my feelings on grading]: http://blog.jasonpbecker.com/2012/09/19/thoughts-on-grading/\n[^0]: From 79 to 97 according to EconTalk\n[^1]: I use \"grit\" a lot in this post. Please insert quotes each time. It got obnoxious reading it with the quotes actually in place\n[^2]: My term, not his. Probably stolen from one of my colleagues who uses this term a lot. \n[^3]: among other non-cognitive, non-academic skills and activities\n[^4]: Or inadvertently measuring both at once, as many low-stakes standardized tests do\n",

				"title": "There must be an easier way... survey questions in R",
				"content_html": "<p>So I have this great little custom function I&rsquo;ve used when looking at survey data in R. I call this function <code>pull()</code>. The goal of <code>pull()</code> is to quickly produce frequency tables with n sizes from individual-level survey data.</p>\n\n<p>Before using <code>pull()</code>, I create a big table that includes information about the survey questions I want to pull. The data are structured like this:</p>\n\n<p><table align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<tbody>\n</p>\n<p>\n<tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nquest</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nsurvey</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nyear</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nbreak</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n</tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n<tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nss01985</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nelementary</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\n2011_12</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nschoolcode</p>\n\n<p></td>\n</p>\n<p>\n</tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n</tbody>\n</p>\n<p>\n</table>\n</p></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>quest represents the question coding in the raw survey data.</li>\n<li>survey is the name of the survey (in my case, the elementary school students, middle school students, high school students, parents, teachers, or administrators).</li>\n<li>year is the year that the survey data are collected.</li>\n<li>break is the ID I want to aggregate on like schoolcode or districtcode.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They key is that <code>paste(survey, year,sep='')</code> produces the name of the <code>data.frame</code> where I store the relevant survey data. Both quest and break are columns in the survey data.frame. Using a data.frame with this data allows me to apply through the rows and produce the table for all the relevant questions at once. <code>pull()</code> does the work of taking one row of this <code>data.frame</code> and producing the output that I&rsquo;m looking for. I also use <code>pull()</code> one row at a time to save a data.frame that contains these data and do other things (like the visualizations in this post).</p>\n\n<p>In some sense, <code>pull()</code> is really just a fancy version of <code>prop.table</code> that takes in passed paramaters and adds an &ldquo;n&rdquo; to each row and adding a &ldquo;total&rdquo; row. I feel as though there must be an implementation of an equivalent function in a popular package (or maybe even base) that I should be using rather than this technique. It would probably be more maintainable and easier for collaborators to work with this more common implementation, but I have no idea where to find it. So, please feel free to use the code below, but I&rsquo;m actually hoping that someone will chime in and tell me I&rsquo;ve wasted my time and I should just be using some function foo::bar.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. This post is a great example of why I really need to change this blog to Markdown/R-flavored Markdown.

				"content_text": "\nSo I have this great little custom function I've used when looking at survey data in R. I call this function `pull()`. The goal of `pull()` is to quickly produce frequency tables with n sizes from individual-level survey data.\n\nBefore using `pull()`, I create a big table that includes information about the survey questions I want to pull. The data are structured like this:\n\n<table align=\"center\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<tbody>\n</p>\n<p>\n<tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nquest\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nsurvey\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nyear\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nbreak\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n</tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n<tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nss01985\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nelementary\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\n2011\\_12\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n<td>\nschoolcode\n\n</td>\n</p>\n<p>\n</tr>\n</p>\n<p>\n</tbody>\n</p>\n<p>\n</table>\n</p>\n\n*   quest represents the question coding in the raw survey data.\n*   survey is the name of the survey (in my case, the elementary school students, middle school students, high school students, parents, teachers, or administrators).\n*   year is the year that the survey data are collected.\n*   break is the ID I want to aggregate on like schoolcode or districtcode.\n\nThey key is that `paste(survey, year,sep='')` produces the name of the `data.frame` where I store the relevant survey data. Both quest and break are columns in the survey data.frame. Using a data.frame with this data allows me to apply through the rows and produce the table for all the relevant questions at once. `pull()` does the work of taking one row of this `data.frame` and producing the output that I'm looking for. I also use `pull()` one row at a time to save a data.frame that contains these data and do other things (like the visualizations in this post).\n\nIn some sense, `pull()` is really just a fancy version of `prop.table` that takes in passed paramaters and adds an \"n\" to each row and adding a \"total\" row. I feel as though there must be an implementation of an equivalent function in a popular package (or maybe even base) that I should be using rather than this technique. It would probably be more maintainable and easier for collaborators to work with this more common implementation, but I have no idea where to find it. So, please feel free to use the code below, but I'm actually hoping that someone will chime in and tell me I've wasted my time and I should just be using some function foo::bar.\n\nP.S. This post is a great example of why I really need to change this blog to Markdown/R-flavored Markdown. All those inline references to functions, variables, or code should really be formatted in-line which the syntax highlighter plug-in used on this blog does not support. I'm nervous that using WP-Markdown plugin will botch formatting on older posts, so I may just need to setup a workflow where I pump out HTML from the Markdown and upload the posts from there. If anyone has experience with Markdown + Wordpress, advice is appreciated.\n\n\n```r\npull <- function(rows){\n  # Takes in a vector with all the information required to create crosstab with\n  # percentages for a specific question for all schools.\n  # Args:\n  #  rows: Consists of a vector with four objects.\n  #        quest: the question code from SurveyWorks\n  #        level: the \"level\" of the survey, i.e.: elem, midd, high, teac, admn,\n  #        pare, etc.\n  #        year: the year the survey was administered, i.e. 2011_12\n  #        sch_lea: the \"break\" indicator, i.e. schoolcode, districtcode, etc.\n  # Returns:\n  # A data.frame with a row for each \"break\", i.e. school, attributes for\n  # each possible answer to quest, i.e. Agree and Disagree, and N size for each\n  # break based on how many people responded to that question, not the survey as\n  # a whole, i.e. \n\n  # Break each component of the vector rows into separate single-element vectors\n  # for convenience and clarity.\n  quest <- as.character(rows[1])\n  survey <- as.character(rows[2])\n  year  <- as.character(rows[3])\n  break <- as.character(rows[4])\n  data <- get(paste(level,year,sep=''))\n  # Data is an alias for the data.frame described by level and year.\n  # This alias reduces the number of \"get\" calls to speed up code and increase\n  # clarity.\n  results <- with(data,\n                  dcast(data.frame(prop.table(table(data[[break]],\n                                                    data[[quest]]),\n                                              1))\n                        ,Var1~Var2,value.var='Freq'))\n  # Produces a table with the proportions for each response in wide format.\n  n <- data.frame(Var1=rle(sort(\n    subset(data, \n           is.na(data[[quest]])==F & is.na(data[[break]])==F)[[break]]))$values,\n                  n=rle(sort(\n                    subset(data,\n                           is.na(data[[quest]])==F &\n                             is.na(data[[break]])==F)[[break]]))$lengths)\n  # Generates a data frame with each break element and the \"length\" of that break\n  # element. rle counts the occurrences of a value in a vector in order.

First, one portion of the state constitution has recently been changed that was used in the prior ruling. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision stated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, in no measure did the 1986 Constitution alter the plenary and exclusive powers of the General Assembly. In fact, the 1986 Constitution provided that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The general assembly shall continue to exercise the powers it has heretofore exercised, unless prohibited in this Constitution.&rdquo; Art. 6, sec. 10.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially, the judge stated that this section of the state constitution meant that the legislature was retaining the right to exercise its powers as it had historically. In the case of education, this means &ldquo;the power to promote public education through a statutory funding scheme and through reliance on local property taxation,&rdquo; in accordance with the findings in the decision. However, Article 6, section 10 of the state constitution has subsequently been repealed. It is worth repeating what I said previously, <strong>I am not a legal expert</strong>. However, I find the argument to overturn *Pawtucket* on the basis that the General Assembly is no longer expressly continuing to exercise their power as previously to be weak. My understanding of the *Pawtucket* ruling is that the court had only strengthened importance of historical context in making this decision by leaning on this constitutional provision. The importance of historical context still remains, even without this provision. In the <em>Pawtucket</em> decision, the &ldquo;exercise of powers it has heretofore exercised&rdquo; is interpreted to mean that unchanged constitutional language reflects unchanged powers. By maintaining the same language in 1986, despite amendments offered that would have more explicitly established a right to education, the General Assembly was, in effect, affirming its intent to continue to <em>promote</em> education as it had in the past. The plaintiffs in the current case, presumably, will argue that without Article 6, section 10, the General Assembly is allowing the courts to reinterpret even the same language to imply a different set of rights and responsibilities than it has historically. I have to ask, if the General Assembly&rsquo;s intent was to signal that Article XII should now be interpreted as establishing a right to education, why wouldn&rsquo;t they have adopted new, clearer language as was proposed in 1986? Having full awareness of the decision in <em>Pawtucket</em>, it is hard to see that the General Assembly would signal a change in its power and responsibility to promote education through a repeal of Article 6, section 10. I would assert this change simply shifts some of the burden to the finding that the General Assembly *sees fit* the *promot[ion]* of some judicable standard right to education that is the state&rsquo;s fiscal responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>This is the critical piece that the plaintiffs will not find. Nowhere has the General Assembly exercised its power to *promote *in this way. In fact, one only has to look at how the General Assembly has acted to establish a judicable right to education to observe precisely how <em>it sees fit</em>. <a href=\"http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/statutes/title16/16-7/16-7-24.htm\">Rhode Island General Law 16-7-24</a>, titled &ldquo;Minimum appropriation by a community for approved school expenses,&rdquo; is a provision that all school committees are quite familiar with. Here, the General Assembly do establish a judicable standard for education, set by the Board of Regents of Elementary and Secondary Education in regulations known as the &ldquo;basic education program&rdquo;. But where *Pawtucket* fails to establish a <strong>constitutional guarantee for state funding</strong> in a particular amount for education, Rhode Island <strong>statute</strong> is quite clear on a minimum standard for <strong>local</strong> support. The law states that &ldquo;Each community shall appropriate or otherwise make available&hellip; an amount, which together with state education and federal aid&hellip; shall be not less than the costs of the basic program&hellip; The Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education shall adopt regulations for determining the basic education program&hellip;&rdquo; In other words, Rhode Island statute squarely places the burden for meeting the Basic Education Program on cities and towns raising the required revenue. &ldquo;A community that has a local appropriation insufficient to fund the basic education program … shall be required to increase its local appropriation…&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It seems pretty clear to me. While the plaintiffs in the current case will presumably argue that state regulations and laws *do* represent a judicable standard, they will be unable to find where the General Assembly, through action, has affirmed that it is the role of the state aid to meet this standard. Instead, the law directly states that <strong>local appropriations</strong> are to be increased if the Basic Education Program cannot be met.

				"title": "Limitations of the Nesi's Notes Analysis and Some Additional Questions",
				"content_html": "<p>There are several questions that come to mind when looking over my analysis on <a href=\"http://blogs.wpri.com/category/nesis-notes/\">Nesi&rsquo;s Notes</a>. The first thing I wondered was whether or not Woonsocket had raised local revenues by similar amounts to other communities but had chosen to spend this money on other municipal services. Ideally, I would use a chart that showed local education revenues compared to all other local revenues over the last 15 years by city in Rhode Island. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.muni-info.ri.gov/\">Municipal Finance</a> does not separate local, state, and federal revenue sources in the <a href=\"http://www.muni-info.ri.gov/finances/municipal_budget_survey.php\">Municipal Budget Survey</a> so it is hard to know<em>how</em> communities have funded different services. I am sure with a bit of finagling, I could come up with a fairly good guess as to whether or not Woonsocket has simply chosen to fund other municipal services with its taxes, but quite frankly it is not precise enough to make me feel like its worth the exercise of extracting data from PDF tables. I hope someone else will take up some form of this analysis, possibly by requesting the breakdowns from Municipal Finance.</p>\n\n<p>Another consideration is whether there is any truth to Woonsocket&rsquo;s claims that it simply does not have the ability to generate enough local revenue for their schools. I am skeptical on this claim. Three pieces of evidence suggest to me that this may not be true.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The magnitude of the shortfall between the rest of the state and Woonsocket over the last 15 years when it comes to local education revenue</strong>. On its face, I don&rsquo;t find it credible that Woonsocket&rsquo;s tax base is so weak that it could not increase local revenues for schools even at the rate of inflation. Not increasing local revenue for schools seems to leave only two possibilities: 1) local revenues in general were not increased, meaning Woonsocket would have to argue that its taxation in FY95 was so high relative to everyone else that it took nearly 15 years for the rest of the state to catch up, hence no additional revenues; or 2) Woonsocket did raise local revenues, and chose to spend the money elsewhere. Had Woonsocket&rsquo;s local education aid risen 65-75% versus a state average of around 100%, I probably would not have even written my post on Nesi&rsquo;s Notes.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/candrewmorse\">Andrew Morse</a>&lsquo;s analysis presented on <a href=\"http://www.anchorrising.com/barnacles/013927.html\">Anchor Rising</a></strong>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> Woonsocket appears to be on the low to typical end of revenues as a proportion of non-poverty income. It does not seem that they are anywhere near the &ldquo;most&rdquo; taxed city or town by this measure.

There are times where marginally the greatest benefit can be had by lowering residents&rsquo; taxes. However, I do think that commercial tax should not be used as a substitute when there isn&rsquo;t enough revenue in the pie. In Woonsocket&rsquo;s case, it seems pretty clear they needed both the residential and commercial taxes to have sufficient revenues.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:1\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",
				"content_text": "\nThere are several questions that come to mind when looking over my analysis on [Nesi's Notes][]. The first thing I wondered was whether or not Woonsocket had raised local revenues by similar amounts to other communities but had chosen to spend this money on other municipal services. Ideally, I would use a chart that showed local education revenues compared to all other local revenues over the last 15 years by city in Rhode Island. Unfortunately, [Municipal Finance][] does not separate local, state, and federal revenue sources in the [Municipal Budget Survey][] so it is hard to know*how* communities have funded different services. I am sure with a bit of finagling, I could come up with a fairly good guess as to whether or not Woonsocket has simply chosen to fund other municipal services with its taxes, but quite frankly it is not precise enough to make me feel like its worth the exercise of extracting data from PDF tables. I hope someone else will take up some form of this analysis, possibly by requesting the breakdowns from Municipal Finance.\n\nAnother consideration is whether there is any truth to Woonsocket's claims that it simply does not have the ability to generate enough local revenue for their schools. I am skeptical on this claim. Three pieces of evidence suggest to me that this may not be true.\n\n1.  **The magnitude of the shortfall between the rest of the state and Woonsocket over the last 15 years when it comes to local education revenue**. On its face, I don't find it credible that Woonsocket's tax base is so weak that it could not increase local revenues for schools even at the rate of inflation. Not increasing local revenue for schools seems to leave only two possibilities: 1) local revenues in general were not increased, meaning Woonsocket would have to argue that its taxation in FY95 was so high relative to everyone else that it took nearly 15 years for the rest of the state to catch up, hence no additional revenues; or 2) Woonsocket did raise local revenues, and chose to spend the money elsewhere. Had Woonsocket's local education aid risen 65-75% versus a state average of around 100%, I probably would not have even written my post on Nesi's Notes.\n2.  **[Andrew Morse][]'s analysis presented on [Anchor Rising][]**.[^1] Woonsocket appears to be on the low to typical end of revenues as a proportion of non-poverty income. It does not seem that they are anywhere near the \"most\" taxed city or town by this measure. I am not an expert on tax policy, but this measure seems fairly straightforward, fair, and informative.\n3.  **The mammoth proportions of Woonsocket's budget being spent on pensions (through debt service) and other post-employment benefits**. [A full 15% or so of Woonsocket's local revenues are being spent in these areas][]. This suggests to me misappropriation and poor planning has led to the erosion of local support for schools, not a lack of revenue generating capacity. If this truly is the case, then Woonsocket residents are really in trouble. Their leaders have managed to generate all of the high costs and high taxes experienced in Rhode Island without providing the quality of service that should be expected given those investments.\n\nOf course, I failed to offer any recommendation for remedy in the Nesi's Note post. How should Woonsocket schools become \"whole\" again? How can this possibly be accomplished in the context of a city on the brink of financial failure? Who has the legal responsibility to ensure that Woonsocket's children get the education they deserve? I have no answers on the first two points. However, in the next section of this post I hope answer the last question, which is also the subject of a law suit filed by Pawtucket and Woonsocket against the state of Rhode Island.\n\nWho is responsible for ensuring students are receiving a certain minimum quality education?\n\n*This post is the first of a three-part follow up on my [guest post][Nesi's Notes] for Nesi's Notes.

The per pupil amounts reported to NCES may look a bit different from state sources of this information. There are several explanations of this. First, the enrollment counts used to generate per pupil amounts are based on an October 1st headcount. In Rhode Island, we use something called &ldquo;average daily membership&rdquo; (ADM) as the denominator and not a headcount. The ADM of a district is calculated by taking all the students who attended the district at any point in the year and adding up the number of school days they were enrolled for. The total membership (i.e. all the student*days, for those who like to think about this in units) is divided by the number of school days per year, almost always 180 (so student*days / days/year = students/year). Additionally, NCES does not record the final three digits on most financial data. These rounding issues will also make the per pupil data seem different from state reports.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to use the NCES to make sure that the data in my post was easily reproducible by any member of the public. I also thought using NCES would serve as a great learning opportunity for the wonks and nerds out there who never even realized how much rich data about schools and school finance are available through the federal government. That being said, I do believe that the state reported numbers are far more accurate than those available from the federal government. That is not to say that the federal data is bad. On the contrary, that data is substantially vetted and validated and is very useful for research. My concern was only that some of the tiny differences in the NCES data that deviated from what I would consider to be ideal data might reach the level where they affected the validity of the conclusions I wanted to draw.</p>\n\n<p>Although I was writing as a private citizen without the support of the Rhode Island Department of Education, I did use my access to RIDE data to ensure that differences in the federal reports were not significant enough to call into question my analysis. I found that both the direction and magnitude of all the trends that I describe in the Nesi&rsquo;s Notes post held up with the state data. While all of that information is publicly available, it is less easily accessible than NCES data and doesn&rsquo;t provide the same opportunity for analysis outside of financial data. For these reasons, I decided to stick with NCES.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you reproduce the data I used?</p>\n\n<p>First, go to  the <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/bat\">NCES Common Core Data Build a Table</a> site.

In Rhode Island, we use something called \"average daily membership\" (ADM) as the denominator and not a headcount. The ADM of a district is calculated by taking all the students who attended the district at any point in the year and adding up the number of school days they were enrolled for. The total membership (i.e. all the student\\*days, for those who like to think about this in units) is divided by the number of school days per year, almost always 180 (so student\\*days / days/year = students/year). Additionally, NCES does not record the final three digits on most financial data. These rounding issues will also make the per pupil data seem different from state reports.\n\nI wanted to use the NCES to make sure that the data in my post was easily reproducible by any member of the public. I also thought using NCES would serve as a great learning opportunity for the wonks and nerds out there who never even realized how much rich data about schools and school finance are available through the federal government. That being said, I do believe that the state reported numbers are far more accurate than those available from the federal government. That is not to say that the federal data is bad. On the contrary, that data is substantially vetted and validated and is very useful for research. My concern was only that some of the tiny differences in the NCES data that deviated from what I would consider to be ideal data might reach the level where they affected the validity of the conclusions I wanted to draw.\n\nAlthough I was writing as a private citizen without the support of the Rhode Island Department of Education, I did use my access to RIDE data to ensure that differences in the federal reports were not significant enough to call into question my analysis. I found that both the direction and magnitude of all the trends that I describe in the Nesi's Notes post held up with the state data. While all of that information is publicly available, it is less easily accessible than NCES data and doesn't provide the same opportunity for analysis outside of financial data. For these reasons, I decided to stick with NCES.\n\nSo how do you reproduce the data I used?\n\nFirst, go to  the [NCES Common Core Data Build a Table][] site. On the drop down, select \"District\" as the row variable and select the last fifteen years excluding 2009-10 (since there is no current financial data available for that year).\n\n![1][]\n\nAfter clicking next, hit \"I Agree\" on the pop-up.\n\n![2][]\n\nNow select \"Finance Per Pupil Ratios\" for the first column.\n\n![3][]\n\nClick the green arrow that selects all years for local sources per\nstudent and state sources per student.\n\n![4][]\n\nClick \"Next\\>\\>\" on the top right. Now select only RI-Rhode Island for\nyour row variable.\n\n![5][]\n\nFinally, click view table to see the results. I recommend downloading\nthe Test (.csv) file to work with.\n\n![6][]\n\nAnd finally, here's the R code to reshape/rejigger the data I used and\nproduce the graphics from the Nesi's Notes post.\n\n```r    \n## Using NCES data to analyze education finances to Woonsocket over 15 years.\n## Initialize required packages\nrequire(plyr)\nrequire(reshape2)\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(scales)\n## Best to ignore this function-- it's mostly magic to me too.

In my efforts to be generic as possible, I decided to generate some fake data from scratch. As I peeled away the layers of context-specific aspects of my nearing-production level code, I ran into all kinds of trouble. So I apologize for the somewhat sloppy and unfinished code<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2020/b9690b17c2.png\" alt=\"Rankedlikert\" title=\"rankedlikert.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /> <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:netstacked\"><a href=\"#fn:netstacked\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>My preferred method for visualizing Likert-scale data from surveys is using <a href=\"http://www.organizationview.com/net-stacked-distribution-a-better-way-to-visualize-likert-data\">net stacked distribution graphs</a>. There are two major benefits of these kinds of graphs. First, they immediately draw attention to <em>how strongly</em> respondents feel about a question, particularly when multiple questions are visualized at once. The total width of any bar is equal to the total number of responded who had a non-neutral answer. Second, these graphs make it very easy to distinguish between positive and negative responses. In some cases, it is critical to view the distribution of data to visualize the differences in responses to one question or another. However, most of the time it is informative enough to simply know how positive or negative responses are. I find this is particularly true with 3, 4, and 5-point Likert scales, the most common I come across in education research.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, without further ado, some starter code for producing net stacked distribution graphs.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">require(ggplot2)\nrequire(scales)\nrequire(plyr)\ndataSet &lt;- data.frame(\n  q1=as.ordered(round(runif(1500, 1, 15) + runif(1500,1,15))),\n  q2=as.ordered(round(runif(1500, 1, 15) + runif(1500,1,15))))\ndataSet[['q1']] &lt;- with(dataSet, ifelse(q1&lt;7,1,\n                                       ifelse(q1&gt;=7 &amp; q1&lt;13,2,\n                                             ifelse(q1&gt;=13 &amp; q1&lt;20,3,\n                                                   ifelse(q1&gt;=20 &amp; q1&lt;26,4,5)))))\ndataSet[['q2']] &lt;- with(dataSet, ifelse(q2&lt;3,1,\n                                       ifelse(q2&gt;=3 &amp; q2&lt;14,2,\n                                             ifelse(q2&gt;=14 &amp; q2&lt;26,3,\n                                                   ifelse(q2&gt;=26 &amp; q2&lt;28,4,5)))))\ndataSet[['q1']] &lt;- as.ordered(dataSet[['q1']])\ndataSet[['q2']] &lt;- as.ordered(dataSet[['q2']])\nlevels(dataSet[['q1']]) &lt;- c('Strongly Disagree',\n                             'Disagree',\n                             'Neither Agree or Disagree',\n                             'Agree',\n                             'Strongly Agree')\nlevels(dataSet[['q2']]) &lt;- c('Strongly Disagree',\n                             'Disagree',\n                             'Neither Agree or Disagree',\n                             'Agree',\n                             'Strongly Agree')\n# Convert the integer levels to have meaning.\nq1Proportions &lt;- data.frame(Name='q1', prop.table(table(dataSet[['q1']])))\nq2Proportions &lt;- data.frame(Name='q2', prop.table(table(dataSet[['q2']])))\n# Produces a data frame with the proportions of respondents in each level.\n\n# ggplot2 function for graphs\nvisualize &lt;- function(data,\n                      responses=c('Strongly Disagree',\n                                  'Disagree',\n                                  'Neither Agree or Disagree',\n                                  'Agree',\n                                  'Strongly Agree'),\n                      desc='Title',\n                      rm.neutral=TRUE){\n  # This function will create net stacked distribution graphs.

Below, I have included my comment on his blog as well as an actual copy of my current production code (which definitely is not sufficiently refactored for easy use across multiple projects). Again, excuse what I consider to be incomplete work on my part. I do intend on refactoring this code and eventually including it in my broader set of custom functions available across all of my projects. I suspect along that path that I will be &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; some of Ethan&rsquo;s ideas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"comment\">Comment</h3>\n\n<p>Hi Ethan! Super excited to see this post. This is exactly why I put up my code&ndash; so others could run with it. There are a few things that you do here that I actually already had implemented into my code and removed in an attempt to be more neutral to scale that I really like.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, in my actual production code I also separate out the positive and negative responses. In my code, I have a parameter called <code>scaleName</code> that allows me to switch between all of the scales that are available in my survey data. This includes Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (<code>scaleName=='sdsa'</code>), Never -&gt; Always (<code>scaleName=='sdsa'</code>) and even simple yes/no (<code>scaleName=='ny'</code>). This is not ideal because it does require 1) knowing all possible scales and including some work in the function to treat them differently 2) including an additional parameter. However, because I use this work to analyze just a few surveys, the upfront work of including this as a parameter has made this very flexible in dealing with multiple scales. As a result, I do not need to require that the columns are ordered in any particular way, just that the titles match existing scales. So I have a long set of if elseif statements that look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"> if(scaleName=='sdsa'){\n scale &lt;- c('Strongly Disagree','Disagree','Agree','Strongly Agree')\n pos &lt;- c('Agree','Strongly Agree')\n neg &lt;- c('Strongly Disagree','Disagree')\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is actually really helpful for producing negative values and including some scales in my function which do not have values that are negative (so that it can be used for general stacked charts instead of just net-stacked):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">if(length(neg)&gt;0){\nquest[,names(quest) %in% c(neg)] &lt;- -(quest[,names(quest) %in% c(neg)])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Recall that quest is what I call the dataframe and is equivalent to x in your code)</p>\n\n<p>Another neat trick that I have instituted is having dynamic x-axis limits rather than always going from -100 to 100. I generally like to keep my scales representing the full logical range of data (0 - 100 for percentages, etc) so I might consider this a manipulation. However, after getting many charts with stubby centers, I found I was not really seeing sufficient variation by sticking to my -100 to 100 setup. So I added this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">pos_lims =0)+1))[1,]),\nsum(subset(quest,select=c(which(quest[2,-1]&gt;=0)+1))[2,])))\nneg_lims &lt;- max(abs(c(sum(subset(quest, \n                                 select=c(which(quest[1,-1]&lt;=0) + 1))[1,]),\nsum(subset(quest,select=c(which(quest[2,-1]&lt;=0)+1))[2,]))))\nx_axis_lims &lt;- max(pos_lims,neg_lims)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which helps to determine the value furthest from 0 in either direction across the data frame (I have to admit, this code looks a bit like magic reading it back. My comments actually are quite helpful:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\"># pos_lims and neg_lims subset each row of the data based on sign, then\n# sums the values that remain (gettting the total positive or negative\n# percentage for each row). Then, the max of the rows is saved as a candidate\n# for the magnitude of the axis.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To make this more generalizable (my production code always compares two bars at once) , it would be fairly trivial to loop over all the rows (or use the apply functions which I&rsquo;m still trying to get a hang of).</p>\n\n<p>I then pad the <code>x_limits</code> value by some percent inside the <code>limits</code> attribute.</p>\n\n<p>In my production code I also have the <code>scale_fill_manual</code> attribute\nadded separately to the ggplot object. However, rather than add this\nafter the fact like at the point of rendering, I include this in my\nfunction again set by <code>scaleName</code>. However, I think the best organization\nis probably to have a separate function that makes it easy to select the\ncolor scheme you want and apply it so that your final call could be\nsomething like <code>colorNetStacked(net_stacked(x), 'blues')</code>.</p>\n\n<p>My actual final return looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">    return(stackedchart + scale_fill_manual(limits=scale,\n    values=colors) +\n    coord_flip())\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where colors is set by a line like: <code>colors &lt;- brewer.pal(name='Blues',n=7)[3:7]</code></p>\n\n<p>Seriously though, I am super excited you found my post and thought it was useful and improved what I presented!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"current-production-code\">Current production code:</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">visualize &lt;- function(quest,scaleName='sdsa',desc){\n  # Produces the main net-stacked Likert graphic used for survey data in the\n  # diagnostic tool\n  # Args:\n  #  quest: data.frame from pull() or pullByLevel() output\n  #  scaleName: string code for the type of scale that is used for the question.\n  #  desc: string for the title that will be displayed on the graphic.\n  # Returns:\n  # Net-Stacked Likert chart with a bar/row for each row in quest.

				"content_text": "\n## Update\nSee below for more information now that Ethan Brown has [weighed in with some great code][].\n\n\n\nA [recent post][] I came across on [r-bloggers][] asked for input on visualizing ranked [Likert-scale data][].\n\nI happen to be working on a substantial project using very similarly structured data so I thought I would share some code. In my efforts to be generic as possible, I decided to generate some fake data from scratch. As I peeled away the layers of context-specific aspects of my nearing-production level code, I ran into all kinds of trouble. So I apologize for the somewhat sloppy and unfinished code[^1].\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2020/b9690b17c2.png\" alt=\"Rankedlikert\" title=\"rankedlikert.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" /> [^netstacked]\n\nMy preferred method for visualizing Likert-scale data from surveys is using [net stacked distribution graphs][]. There are two major benefits of these kinds of graphs. First, they immediately draw attention to *how strongly* respondents feel about a question, particularly when multiple questions are visualized at once. The total width of any bar is equal to the total number of responded who had a non-neutral answer. Second, these graphs make it very easy to distinguish between positive and negative responses. In some cases, it is critical to view the distribution of data to visualize the differences in responses to one question or another. However, most of the time it is informative enough to simply know how positive or negative responses are. I find this is particularly true with 3, 4, and 5-point Likert scales, the most common I come across in education research.\n\nAnyway, without further ado, some starter code for producing net stacked distribution graphs.\n\n```r\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(scales)\nrequire(plyr)\ndataSet <- data.frame(\n  q1=as.ordered(round(runif(1500, 1, 15) + runif(1500,1,15))),\n  q2=as.ordered(round(runif(1500, 1, 15) + runif(1500,1,15))))\ndataSet[['q1']] <- with(dataSet, ifelse(q1<7,1,\n                                       ifelse(q1>=7 & q1<13,2,\n                                             ifelse(q1>=13 & q1<20,3,\n                                                   ifelse(q1>=20 & q1<26,4,5)))))\ndataSet[['q2']] <- with(dataSet, ifelse(q2<3,1,\n                                       ifelse(q2>=3 & q2<14,2,\n                                             ifelse(q2>=14 & q2<26,3,\n                                                   ifelse(q2>=26 & q2<28,4,5)))))\ndataSet[['q1']] <- as.ordered(dataSet[['q1']])\ndataSet[['q2']] <- as.ordered(dataSet[['q2']])\nlevels(dataSet[['q1']]) <- c('Strongly Disagree',\n                             'Disagree',\n                             'Neither Agree or Disagree',\n                             'Agree',\n                             'Strongly Agree')\nlevels(dataSet[['q2']]) <- c('Strongly Disagree',\n                             'Disagree',\n                             'Neither Agree or Disagree',\n                             'Agree',\n                             'Strongly Agree')\n# Convert the integer levels to have meaning.\nq1Proportions <- data.frame(Name='q1', prop.table(table(dataSet[['q1']])))\nq2Proportions <- data.frame(Name='q2', prop.table(table(dataSet[['q2']])))\n# Produces a data frame with the proportions of respondents in each level.\n\n# ggplot2 function for graphs\nvisualize <- function(data,\n                      responses=c('Strongly Disagree',\n                                  'Disagree',\n                                  'Neither Agree or Disagree',\n                                  'Agree',\n                                  'Strongly Agree'),\n                      desc='Title',\n                      rm.neutral=TRUE){\n  # This function will create net stacked distribution graphs.

Below, I have included my comment on his blog as well as an actual copy of my current production code (which definitely is not sufficiently refactored for easy use across multiple projects). Again, excuse what I consider to be incomplete work on my part. I do intend on refactoring this code and eventually including it in my broader set of custom functions available across all of my projects. I suspect along that path that I will be \"stealing\" some of Ethan's ideas.\n\n### Comment\n\nHi Ethan! Super excited to see this post. This is exactly why I put up my code-- so others could run with it. There are a few things that you do here that I actually already had implemented into my code and removed in an attempt to be more neutral to scale that I really like.\n\nFor starters, in my actual production code I also separate out the positive and negative responses. In my code, I have a parameter called `scaleName` that allows me to switch between all of the scales that are available in my survey data. This includes Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (`scaleName=='sdsa'`), Never -\\> Always (`scaleName=='sdsa'`) and even simple yes/no (`scaleName=='ny'`). This is not ideal because it does require 1) knowing all possible scales and including some work in the function to treat them differently 2) including an additional parameter. However, because I use this work to analyze just a few surveys, the upfront work of including this as a parameter has made this very flexible in dealing with multiple scales. As a result, I do not need to require that the columns are ordered in any particular way, just that the titles match existing scales. So I have a long set of if elseif statements that look something like this:\n\n ```r\n if(scaleName=='sdsa'){\n scale <- c('Strongly Disagree','Disagree','Agree','Strongly Agree')\n pos <- c('Agree','Strongly Agree')\n neg <- c('Strongly Disagree','Disagree')\n }\n```\n\nThis is actually really helpful for producing negative values and including some scales in my function which do not have values that are negative (so that it can be used for general stacked charts instead of just net-stacked):\n\n```r\nif(length(neg)>0){\nquest[,names(quest) %in% c(neg)] <- -(quest[,names(quest) %in% c(neg)])\n```\n\n(Recall that quest is what I call the dataframe and is equivalent to x in your code)\n\nAnother neat trick that I have instituted is having dynamic x-axis limits rather than always going from -100 to 100. I generally like to keep my scales representing the full logical range of data (0 - 100 for percentages, etc) so I might consider this a manipulation. However, after getting many charts with stubby centers, I found I was not really seeing sufficient variation by sticking to my -100 to 100 setup. So I added this:\n\n```r\npos_lims =0)+1))[1,]),\nsum(subset(quest,select=c(which(quest[2,-1]>=0)+1))[2,])))\nneg_lims <- max(abs(c(sum(subset(quest, \n                                 select=c(which(quest[1,-1]<=0) + 1))[1,]),\nsum(subset(quest,select=c(which(quest[2,-1]<=0)+1))[2,]))))\nx_axis_lims <- max(pos_lims,neg_lims)\n```\n\nWhich helps to determine the value furthest from 0 in either direction across the data frame (I have to admit, this code looks a bit like magic reading it back. My comments actually are quite helpful:\n\n\n```r\n# pos_lims and neg_lims subset each row of the data based on sign, then\n# sums the values that remain (gettting the total positive or negative\n# percentage for each row). Then, the max of the rows is saved as a candidate\n# for the magnitude of the axis.\n```\n\nTo make this more generalizable (my production code always compares two bars at once) , it would be fairly trivial to loop over all the rows (or use the apply functions which I'm still trying to get a hang of).\n\nI then pad the `x_limits` value by some percent inside the `limits` attribute.\n\nIn my production code I also have the `scale_fill_manual` attribute\nadded separately to the ggplot object. However, rather than add this\nafter the fact like at the point of rendering, I include this in my\nfunction again set by `scaleName`. However, I think the best organization\nis probably to have a separate function that makes it easy to select the\ncolor scheme you want and apply it so that your final call could be\nsomething like `colorNetStacked(net_stacked(x), 'blues')`.\n\nMy actual final return looks like this:\n\n```r\n    return(stackedchart + scale_fill_manual(limits=scale,\n    values=colors) +\n    coord_flip())\n```\n\nWhere colors is set by a line like: `colors <- brewer.pal(name='Blues',n=7)[3:7]`\n\nSeriously though, I am super excited you found my post and thought it was useful and improved what I presented!\n\n### Current production code:\n\n```r\nvisualize <- function(quest,scaleName='sdsa',desc){\n  # Produces the main net-stacked Likert graphic used for survey data in the\n  # diagnostic tool\n  # Args:\n  #  quest: data.frame from pull() or pullByLevel() output\n  #  scaleName: string code for the type of scale that is used for the question.\n  #  desc: string for the title that will be displayed on the graphic.\n  # Returns:\n  # Net-Stacked Likert chart with a bar/row for each row in quest.

				"content_html": "<p>How can we tell if principal directives are fair to teachers?</p>\n\n<p>There has been a great conversation circling some blogs I read over the last week about liberty in the work place.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>\nIssues of fairness in the work place are a constant in today&rsquo;s education conversation. Whether some view it as a form of metaphoric violence on teachers and their profession, while others see a concerted effort to change rigid, bureaucratic systems that prevent effective change<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>, at the heart of education reform <em>du jour</em> are changes to workplace freedom. Improving human capital systems has meant dismantling questionable licensing requirements<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>, dramatic changes in <a href=\"http://www.ride.ri.gov/EducatorQuality/EducatorEvaluation/Default.aspx\">teacher</a> <a href=\"http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/Ensuring+Teacher+Success/IMPACT+(Performance+Assessment)/An+Overview+of+IMPACT\">evaluation</a>, and other dramatic changes to who gets <a href=\"http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2012/may/11/reviews-to-favor-effective-teachers/?print=1\">hired</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_(education)\">fired</a>. Using extended learning time, either through additional instructional days and/or longer school days, to increase student achievement is often considered too costly, because teachers demand more pay for more work. Additional professional development days are similarly costly; teachers are loath to give up additional days in the summer or during school vacations without receiving additional pay. I could go on.</p>\n\n<p>All of these reforms seek to radically change terms and benefits in teacher contracts and state law that represent a string of hard-fought (and won) battles that teachers and their unions pursued for years. The political left, and more specifically the progressive movement, has generally picked up on these attempts as anti-union, anti-collective bargaining, anti-democratic, anti-teacher, and anti-education. There are even a host of conspiracy theories decrying the &ldquo;corporate reformers&rdquo; who are coming into the education realm to break down good, public, democratic systems that are good for Democrats, largely to hurt poor kids and make profits<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, most of this argument is about what individuals ideologies have led them to believe about employee rights and employer rights. I find it increasingly frustrating that these conversations do not address the deeper philosophical differences. This is why I have really enjoyed observing the current conversation between <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/\">Crooked Timber</a>, <a href=\"http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/\">Bleeding Heart Libertarians</a>, and others.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key aspects of the BRG argument<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">5</a></sup>is that worker contracts are unique because many of the terms of employment are ambiguous. Employers should only be permitted to demand that employees partake in activities to which they have consented. The contract is supposedly a signal of this consent, however, because the terms are so often ambiguous, disputes over whether or not it covers an activity are practically a guarantee. So how should these disputes be settled and by whom? BRG would argue that there should be strong worker freedom to make sure that their consent is truly given. They consider the relationship between employer and employee to be naturally coercive, at least in part because they assume the right to end employment has very asymmetric benefits since employees have, presumably, much more to lose than employers when the contract ends. BRG assumes that freedom is best served through a democratic workplace with very powerful employees who have few, if any of their rights restricted in the workplace. On the other hand, BHLers believe that it is possible to consent to restrict ones rights within a contractual relationship, they do not tend to accept that the right to exit affords highly asymmetric freedoms<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\">6</a></sup>, and they feel that freedom is maximized by abstaining from limiting private contracts while maximizing the rights to freely enter and exit contracts.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is macroeconomist Miles Kimball, a recent entrant into the <a href=\"http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/\">blogosphere</a>, whose <a href=\"http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/26531357710/jobs\">comments</a> I felt could most directly be applied to education. If I were to summarize his post, it would be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There are significant pressures against to eliminating freedoms of\nyour workers that end up making them worse at their jobs or lead to\nattracting bad talent.</li>\n<li>Although these pressures exist for &ldquo;The Firm&rdquo;, it is true that\n&ldquo;underbosses&rdquo; with significant power can act in ways that maximize\ntheir personal gain instead of what&rsquo;s good for &ldquo;The Firm&rdquo; and the\npressures are less strong against eliminating freedoms for them than\nthe organization as a whole.</li>\n<li>Nevertheless, they should have the rights to limit/remove freedoms,\nand these limitations should be based on whether they are relevant\nto achieving the organizations pre-stated mission.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, the right outside force to judge whether this was a\nproper imposition to make on employees should be people who have\nsuccessfully navigated the same challenges as The Firm but have no\ndirect interest in The Firms current activities.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Each of these four points, if they are accepted as true, has some interesting applications to education. My translation for education colleagues would be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Districts and states have little reason to make lives shitty for\nteachers. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"#fn:7\">7</a></sup></p></li>\n\n<li><p>But some principals, department heads, and others may have the ability to act in ways that are less than proper. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:8\"><a href=\"#fn:8\">8</a></sup></p></li>\n\n<li><p>Actions that restrict teacher rights should be judged on whether they help the school achieve the district or school&rsquo;s pre-stated mission.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Disputes between teachers and their bosses, should not be adjudicated by a typical jury or judge. Instead, the actions of the principal should be judged by other principals who have been successful, preferably with some distance from the actual organization (i.e. not principals who might compete for the offending principals job or may want to hire or be stuck with that teacher based on the proceedings).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think that points 1 and 2 are fairly obvious. Points 3 and 4, however, are far more interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Kimball is attempting to split the difference a fascinating way. I believe he would accept that employment contracts are, by necessity, &ldquo;ambiguous&rdquo; in the way that BRG defines that term. His argument is, therefore, that the mission and purpose of the organization <strong>should not</strong>be ambiguous. So long as the organization&rsquo;s mission is clear, an employment contract becomes consent to do whatever has a rational basis for furthering those goals. In this way, there is an ethical standard by which we can judge new situations that could never have been anticipated directly at the contracting stage. For example, it may be perfectly reasonable for a principal to require a teacher to spend lunch in the student cafeteria so long as their is a rational basis for believing this would further the mission of the school.</p>\n\n<p>In highly unionized workplaces, work rules are so specific that they remove a substantial portion of the ambiguity in contracting. This is generally seen by the left, union members, and other BRG-like thinkers as a huge victory. It implies full consent to the terms of employment and substantial restriction of an employer&rsquo;s ability to abuse their position and abridge the freedoms of their employees in unethical ways. Schools are generally like this. Practically everything is spelled out about a teacher&rsquo;s position, often to the minute. How long they get to eat lunch, how much unstructured time they get during the day, how long they have to spend time working with other teachers, how long they are allowed to be placed in front of kids, how many kids can be placed in front of a teacher at any given time, these conditions and more are detailed in teacher contracts.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, when I ask a union supporter why they think unions are good, they almost always point out &ldquo;abuses&rdquo; of employers that occurred often before the union wrestled power from the grips of the few and the privileged back to the laborers. I have to wonder how much of their support comes from a lack of common, clear definition of unethical abridgments of freedom in the workplace. The solution to this ambiguity is requiring that all actions be consented to through negotiation and contracting, which also determines that dispute resolution is a matter of contract law. I have to wonder if both workers and their employers would be better off if there was a universal ethical standard like Kimball proposes. This way consent can be given while allowing more ambiguity in the contract itself. Right now employers fight for this ambiguity depending solely on appeals to trust and cooperation, two things that are rarely earned before working with someone as would be required.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I understand labor dispute resolution well enough to comment on the differences between Kimball&rsquo;s fourth suggestion and current practice. However, it is pretty clear to me that enforcement through contract law is costly and inefficient, regardless whether it is effective in adjudicating disputes in an ethical matter. Labor relations boards, as far as I can tell, seem to be a political tool swaying between dramatically increasing worker power, especially when members are current or former full-time employees and members of a union, and increasing employer power when more corporate representation is assured. If only I believed it were possible to have an apolitical, disinterested board, with sector-specific expertise, determine whether there is a &ldquo;rational basis&rdquo; for employer actions that Kimball envisions.</p>\n\n<p>I am left with more questions than answers, but, for me, there is a rich appeal to utilizing the mission of an organization to determine whether the actions of both it and its employees are just.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\"><a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/\">Here</a> is the (socialist?) critique of libertarians and right to work that sparked the discussion.

				"content_text": "\nHow can we tell if principal directives are fair to teachers?\n\nThere has been a great conversation circling some blogs I read over the last week about liberty in the work place.[^1]\nIssues of fairness in the work place are a constant in today's education conversation. Whether some view it as a form of metaphoric violence on teachers and their profession, while others see a concerted effort to change rigid, bureaucratic systems that prevent effective change[^2], at the heart of education reform *du jour* are changes to workplace freedom. Improving human capital systems has meant dismantling questionable licensing requirements[^3], dramatic changes in [teacher](http://www.ride.ri.gov/EducatorQuality/EducatorEvaluation/Default.aspx) [evaluation][], and other dramatic changes to who gets [hired][] or [fired][]. Using extended learning time, either through additional instructional days and/or longer school days, to increase student achievement is often considered too costly, because teachers demand more pay for more work. Additional professional development days are similarly costly; teachers are loath to give up additional days in the summer or during school vacations without receiving additional pay. I could go on.\n\nAll of these reforms seek to radically change terms and benefits in teacher contracts and state law that represent a string of hard-fought (and won) battles that teachers and their unions pursued for years. The political left, and more specifically the progressive movement, has generally picked up on these attempts as anti-union, anti-collective bargaining, anti-democratic, anti-teacher, and anti-education. There are even a host of conspiracy theories decrying the \"corporate reformers\" who are coming into the education realm to break down good, public, democratic systems that are good for Democrats, largely to hurt poor kids and make profits[^4].\n\nFundamentally, most of this argument is about what individuals ideologies have led them to believe about employee rights and employer rights. I find it increasingly frustrating that these conversations do not address the deeper philosophical differences. This is why I have really enjoyed observing the current conversation between [Crooked Timber][], [Bleeding Heart Libertarians][], and others.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the BRG argument[^5]is that worker contracts are unique because many of the terms of employment are ambiguous. Employers should only be permitted to demand that employees partake in activities to which they have consented. The contract is supposedly a signal of this consent, however, because the terms are so often ambiguous, disputes over whether or not it covers an activity are practically a guarantee. So how should these disputes be settled and by whom? BRG would argue that there should be strong worker freedom to make sure that their consent is truly given. They consider the relationship between employer and employee to be naturally coercive, at least in part because they assume the right to end employment has very asymmetric benefits since employees have, presumably, much more to lose than employers when the contract ends. BRG assumes that freedom is best served through a democratic workplace with very powerful employees who have few, if any of their rights restricted in the workplace. On the other hand, BHLers believe that it is possible to consent to restrict ones rights within a contractual relationship, they do not tend to accept that the right to exit affords highly asymmetric freedoms[^6], and they feel that freedom is maximized by abstaining from limiting private contracts while maximizing the rights to freely enter and exit contracts.\n\nHowever, it is macroeconomist Miles Kimball, a recent entrant into the [blogosphere][], whose [comments][] I felt could most directly be applied to education. If I were to summarize his post, it would be:\n\n1.  There are significant pressures against to eliminating freedoms of\n    your workers that end up making them worse at their jobs or lead to\n    attracting bad talent.\n2.  Although these pressures exist for \"The Firm\", it is true that\n    \"underbosses\" with significant power can act in ways that maximize\n    their personal gain instead of what's good for \"The Firm\" and the\n    pressures are less strong against eliminating freedoms for them than\n    the organization as a whole.\n3.  Nevertheless, they should have the rights to limit/remove freedoms,\n    and these limitations should be based on whether they are relevant\n    to achieving the organizations pre-stated mission.\n4.  Ultimately, the right outside force to judge whether this was a\n    proper imposition to make on employees should be people who have\n    successfully navigated the same challenges as The Firm but have no\n    direct interest in The Firms current activities.\n\nEach of these four points, if they are accepted as true, has some interesting applications to education. My translation for education colleagues would be:\n\n1.  Districts and states have little reason to make lives shitty for\n    teachers. [^7]\n\n2.  But some principals, department heads, and others may have the ability to act in ways that are less than proper. [^8]\n\n3.  Actions that restrict teacher rights should be judged on whether they help the school achieve the district or school's pre-stated mission.\n\n4.  Disputes between teachers and their bosses, should not be adjudicated by a typical jury or judge. Instead, the actions of the principal should be judged by other principals who have been successful, preferably with some distance from the actual organization (i.e. not principals who might compete for the offending principals job or may want to hire or be stuck with that teacher based on the proceedings).\n\nI think that points 1 and 2 are fairly obvious.

Although the content was simple, Professor Tim Roughgarden is a fast talker and he does seem to skip some of the small steps that really trip me up when learning math from lectures. For example, in discussing the first recursive method to $n$-digit multiplication, Professor Roughgarden suddenly throws in a $10^n$ and $10^{n/2}$ term that I just couldn&rsquo;t trace. I kept watching the video waiting for an explanation and pondering it in\nmy mind when a few minutes later it hit me; the two terms kept the place information lost when a number is split into its constituent digits <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:constituent\"><a href=\"#fn:constituent\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The About this Course video, however, provided some good advice I intend on following; although there will be no code written as a part of this course to be language neutral, I will be attempting to code each of the described algorithms on my own. Professor Roughgarden&rsquo;s assumption is that this is within the skills of students taking this class. Generally, I believe I am capable of achieving this in at least *some* language. Currently, I prefer to use R. This is not because R is best suited to this kind of work. Rather, it is because I am relatively new to R, and I think that learning to program some fundamental computational tasks will be good for learning the ins and outs of the language.</p>\n\n<p>However, I think I may switch over to using Python later in the course. Why? Because I feel like learning Python and Udacity happens to have a <a href=\"http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/\">course up already to do just that</a>. My hope is to incorporate free online learning into my routine just like I include reading dead-tree books, Google Reader, and mess around on Twitter. So while I can&rsquo;t swear that I&rsquo;ll actually start moving through these two courses (and two more I&rsquo;m interested in starting June 25), I feel having complimentary, simultaneous course work will push me. Each class should reinforce the other and I should see the most benefit if I keep up with both.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, this class is a big time commitment. The first week has 3.5 hours of lecture time allotted. A typical Brown class would meet for only about 2.5 hours a week (three 50 minute classes or two 80 minute classes). That means a lot of time, not including homework or spending time actually coding and implementing the introduced algorithms. Although some of this material is &ldquo;optional&rdquo; (about an hour), that&rsquo;s still pretty intimidating for a free, online, spare time class. Make no mistake, if time commitment is any indicator, this will be every bit as challenging (to actually learn) as a real college course that last this many weeks.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:constituent\">The algorithm called to split an $n$ digit number $x$ into two, $n/2$ digit numbers. What was unstated, but of course true, is that this transformation must result in an expression that was equal to $x$. Of course, $x=10^n * a+10^\\frac{n}{2} * b$ , because the leading digit of $a$ must be in the $n^{th}$ place and the leading digit of $b$ must be in the $\\frac{n}{2}^{th}$ place. Nothing about this is complex to me, but it was not obvious at the speed of conversation. I think working out an actual example of a 4-digit number multiplication, as Professor Roughgarden had with the &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; multiplication algorithm, would have made this far clearer.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:constituent\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Rather, it is because I am relatively new to R, and I think that learning to program some fundamental computational tasks will be good for learning the ins and outs of the language.\n\nHowever, I think I may switch over to using Python later in the course. Why? Because I feel like learning Python and Udacity happens to have a [course up already to do just that][]. My hope is to incorporate free online learning into my routine just like I include reading dead-tree books, Google Reader, and mess around on Twitter. So while I can't swear that I'll actually start moving through these two courses (and two more I'm interested in starting June 25), I feel having complimentary, simultaneous course work will push me. Each class should reinforce the other and I should see the most benefit if I keep up with both.\n\nFinally, this class is a big time commitment. The first week has 3.5 hours of lecture time allotted. A typical Brown class would meet for only about 2.5 hours a week (three 50 minute classes or two 80 minute classes). That means a lot of time, not including homework or spending time actually coding and implementing the introduced algorithms. Although some of this material is \"optional\" (about an hour), that's still pretty intimidating for a free, online, spare time class. Make no mistake, if time commitment is any indicator, this will be every bit as challenging (to actually learn) as a real college course that last this many weeks.\n\n[Algorithms: Design and Analysis Part I]: http://www.algo-class.org\n[CS15]: http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0150.html\n[CS16: Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures]: http://www.cs.brown.du/courses/csci0160html\n[OpenCourseWare]: http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm\n[Udacity]: http://udacity.com/\n[Coursera]: http://www.coursera.org\n[other players]: http://www.codeacademy.com\n[course up already to do just that]: http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs101/\n\n[^constituent]: The algorithm called to split an $n$ digit number $x$ into two, $n/2$ digit numbers. What was unstated, but of course true, is that this transformation must result in an expression that was equal to $x$. Of course, $x=10^n * a+10^\\frac{n}{2} * b$ , because the leading digit of $a$ must be in the $n^{th}$ place and the leading digit of $b$ must be in the $\\frac{n}{2}^{th}$ place. Nothing about this is complex to me, but it was not obvious at the speed of conversation. I think working out an actual example of a 4-digit number multiplication, as Professor Roughgarden had with the \"primitive\" multiplication algorithm, would have made this far clearer.\n",

				"title": "Social Promotion, Tutoring, and Funding",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_promotion\">Social promotion</a>, in education circles, refers to the practice of allowing students to move on to the next grade level or course even though they are unable to demonstrate they have mastered the skills and knowledge they were expected to learn. Ending or reducing social promotion has been a major theme in the standards-based education reform of the last 10-15 years. Ending social promotion feels like a sound, obvious consequence of standards-based education. Each year (or course) comes with set of standards that articulate what students must know and be able to do once complete. Since the standards of the following course will assume proficiency on previous standards, there is a fundamental common sense to prohibiting students to move to the next level before they have conquered all prior levels.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, this is a gross oversimplification bordering on <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>. Allow me to throw a few wrinkles into the carrion calls for social promotion&rsquo;s demise. First, some standards do not come packaged with lofty presumptions of prior knowledge or skills. For example, a student could be quite successful in a high school chemistry or physics course without being successful in biology. In fact many students take these three courses in a sequence which explicitly prevents taking advantage of the natural interrelatedness of these sciences<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>. For sure there are some skills that serve as critical gateways to future standards and expectations, but a student may fail a course while still having all of the core scaffolding in place for the next course level. Second, it is unclear that repeating a class (or entire grade-level) is an effective mechanism to successfully attain acceptable achievement. What proportion of content that will be repeated has a student already successfully learned without need for reinforcement? Are the strategies and pedagogyÂ employed to teach students new material the same as those used to re-teach material? I&rsquo;m doubtful. Then there are behavioral and social concerns. What are the impacts on a student&rsquo;s self-esteem? What are the impacts, particularly in elementary schools, of mixing students at even greater age ranges? If students mustÂ relearn content, reread the same books, etc, what will happen to their level of engagement with the material? What is the impact of isolating students from their friends in a way that might feel like punishment?</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s research on both sides of this issue&ndash; some that demonstrates that students who are held back <a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/edfp.2007.2.4.319\">do better academically</a><sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>, and some that show outcomes are no better or worse. The impact on the socio-emotional side also seems mixed, although there is more consensus around negative consequences for being held back. That being said, much of the research I have read on social promotion looks at all students being held back in various contexts and not specifically examining long-term effects within a large-scale implementation that regularizes the process, which perhaps decreases the social stigma of being held back and increases the efficacy of teachers with held back students. I am having a hard time remembering at the moment, but I can&rsquo;t recall a large-scale study that used regression discontinuity (and instrumental variable) like the previously linked Jay P. Greene Florida study that took a robust look at socio-economic outcomes. Less rigorous methodologies may introduce substantial bias to results<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I generally think that social promotion is not ideal. In a perfect world, principals and district leaders would have a better sense of how well teachers are able to differentiate instruction in their classrooms more precisely. This way, they could adequately determine when a student is so far behind expectations that it is unreasonable to expect teachers toÂ deliver the necessary instruction in a mixed-ability classroom. When a student is that far behind at the end of the school year, targeted summer intervention would attempt to bring a student to within an acceptable range by the start of the next school year. If this fails, then, and only then, should a student be held back.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is new. In fact, Wikipedia led me to an <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/socialpromotion/intro.html\">article about social promotion</a> archived on the US Department of Education webpage from May 1999 that is strikingly similar to everything I wrote above<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Emily Richardson has a great post inÂ <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/02/closing-the-literacy-gap-the-trouble-with-holding-back-students/253065/\">The Atlantic</a>Â <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\">5</a></sup>about an intriguing alternative. <a href=\"https://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/28597\">David Berliner</a>, an Arizona State University professor of education, says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Everybody supports the idea that if a student isn&rsquo;t reading well in\nthird grade that it&rsquo;s a signal that the child needs help. If you hold\nthem back, you&rsquo;re going to spend roughly another \\$10,000 per child\nfor an extra year of schooling. If you spread out that \\$10,000 over\nthe fourth and fifth grades for extra tutoring, in the long run you&rsquo;re\ngoing to get a better outcome.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There has recently been an increase in <a href=\"http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/charter_school_strategies.pdf\">evidence</a> about the efficacy of intensive, very small group (like two-on-one) tutoring at raising academic achievement based on a &ldquo;successful replication&rdquo; of the <a href=\"http://www.matchschool.org/\">MATCH Charter School&rsquo;s</a> tutoring program in the <a href=\"http://www.houstonisd.org/\">Houston Independent School District&rsquo;s</a> <a href=\"http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=436bcd7298b69210VgnVCM10000028147fa6RCRD\">Apollo 20</a> Program<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\">6</a></sup>. Intensive one-on-one support has several key advantages that address some of my &ldquo;wrinkles&rdquo; about social promotion above. The instruction is specifically catered toward the exact standards that a student is weak on (and possibly on standards that are more foundational to future learning). The strategies and techniques used to teach a student may not be the same as whole-classroom, first-time exposure learning. The intervention strategy feels more like a surplus than deficit-driven policy, i.e. students are receiving *more*Â because of their achievement not being &ldquo;punished&rdquo;. And that is not remotely an exhaustive list.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that education funding is not structured to spend the way that Berliner is recommending. Revenues are often raised or doled out on a per pupil basis so holding a student for an extra year will virtually automatically result in additional formula-driven dollars<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"#fn:7\">7</a></sup>. There is no way to flag a student as needing the &ldquo;5th-year high school&rdquo; funding now, in the form of two years of intensive, one-on-one tutoring in elementary or middle school. I am not sure I think that&rsquo;s a good thing, because I really do think that Berliner is on to something here. The cost-effectiveness of the total investment in any one student identified as being at risk of falling seriously behind is likely to be far higher providing a huge influx of resources to be used entirely on individualized intervention rather than offering an entire extra year of education overall and repeating a specific grade.</p>\n\n<p>The logistics of supporting this kind of intervention with anything but local or private revenue is causing my brain to do mental gymnastics, but the complexity might really be worth the benefits.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">An aside for another day.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:1\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">ending social promotion based on standardized assessments offers pretty much a textbook example of regression discontinuity studies, which I think is kind of cool\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:2\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\">Although woefully outdated and using a source from 1986, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_retention#Research\">research section of the Wikipedia page on grade retention</a>Â outlines this in effective and simple language\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:3\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:4\">I did find the article after I wrote this post\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:4\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:5\">And on her blog, The Educated Reporter\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:5\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:6\">Of course there is lot of past research to support this idea, but I do think that <a href=\"http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer\">Fryer</a>&rsquo;s Apollo 20 evaluation has reinvigorated discussion around the effectiveness of this type of intervention in the past several months.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:6\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:7\">In theory, at least.

Ending or reducing social promotion has been a major theme in the standards-based education reform of the last 10-15 years. Ending social promotion feels like a sound, obvious consequence of standards-based education. Each year (or course) comes with set of standards that articulate what students must know and be able to do once complete. Since the standards of the following course will assume proficiency on previous standards, there is a fundamental common sense to prohibiting students to move to the next level before they have conquered all prior levels.\n\nIn reality, this is a gross oversimplification bordering on *reductio ad absurdum*. Allow me to throw a few wrinkles into the carrion calls for social promotion's demise. First, some standards do not come packaged with lofty presumptions of prior knowledge or skills. For example, a student could be quite successful in a high school chemistry or physics course without being successful in biology. In fact many students take these three courses in a sequence which explicitly prevents taking advantage of the natural interrelatedness of these sciences[^1]. For sure there are some skills that serve as critical gateways to future standards and expectations, but a student may fail a course while still having all of the core scaffolding in place for the next course level. Second, it is unclear that repeating a class (or entire grade-level) is an effective mechanism to successfully attain acceptable achievement. What proportion of content that will be repeated has a student already successfully learned without need for reinforcement? Are the strategies and pedagogyÂ employed to teach students new material the same as those used to re-teach material? I'm doubtful. Then there are behavioral and social concerns. What are the impacts on a student's self-esteem? What are the impacts, particularly in elementary schools, of mixing students at even greater age ranges? If students mustÂ relearn content, reread the same books, etc, what will happen to their level of engagement with the material? What is the impact of isolating students from their friends in a way that might feel like punishment?\n\nThere's research on both sides of this issue-- some that demonstrates that students who are held back [do better academically][][^2], and some that show outcomes are no better or worse. The impact on the socio-emotional side also seems mixed, although there is more consensus around negative consequences for being held back. That being said, much of the research I have read on social promotion looks at all students being held back in various contexts and not specifically examining long-term effects within a large-scale implementation that regularizes the process, which perhaps decreases the social stigma of being held back and increases the efficacy of teachers with held back students. I am having a hard time remembering at the moment, but I can't recall a large-scale study that used regression discontinuity (and instrumental variable) like the previously linked Jay P. Greene Florida study that took a robust look at socio-economic outcomes. Less rigorous methodologies may introduce substantial bias to results[^3].\n\nThat being said, I generally think that social promotion is not ideal. In a perfect world, principals and district leaders would have a better sense of how well teachers are able to differentiate instruction in their classrooms more precisely. This way, they could adequately determine when a student is so far behind expectations that it is unreasonable to expect teachers toÂ deliver the necessary instruction in a mixed-ability classroom. When a student is that far behind at the end of the school year, targeted summer intervention would attempt to bring a student to within an acceptable range by the start of the next school year. If this fails, then, and only then, should a student be held back.\n\nNone of this is new. In fact, Wikipedia led me to an [article about social promotion][] archived on the US Department of Education webpage from May 1999 that is strikingly similar to everything I wrote above[^4].\n\nEmily Richardson has a great post inÂ [The Atlantic][]Â [^5]about an intriguing alternative. [David Berliner][], an Arizona State University professor of education, says,\n\n> \"Everybody supports the idea that if a student isn't reading well in\n> third grade that it's a signal that the child needs help. If you hold\n> them back, you're going to spend roughly another \\$10,000 per child\n> for an extra year of schooling. If you spread out that \\$10,000 over\n> the fourth and fifth grades for extra tutoring, in the long run you're\n> going to get a better outcome.\"\n\nThere has recently been an increase in [evidence][] about the efficacy of intensive, very small group (like two-on-one) tutoring at raising academic achievement based on a \"successful replication\" of the [MATCH Charter School's][] tutoring program in the [Houston Independent School District's][] [Apollo 20][] Program[^6]. Intensive one-on-one support has several key advantages that address some of my \"wrinkles\" about social promotion above. The instruction is specifically catered toward the exact standards that a student is weak on (and possibly on standards that are more foundational to future learning). The strategies and techniques used to teach a student may not be the same as whole-classroom, first-time exposure learning. The intervention strategy feels more like a surplus than deficit-driven policy, i.e. students are receiving *more*Â because of their achievement not being \"punished\". And that is not remotely an exhaustive list.\n\nThe problem is that education funding is not structured to spend the way that Berliner is recommending. Revenues are often raised or doled out on a per pupil basis so holding a student for an extra year will virtually automatically result in additional formula-driven dollars[^7]. There is no way to flag a student as needing the \"5th-year high school\" funding now, in the form of two years of intensive, one-on-one tutoring in elementary or middle school. I am not sure I think that's a good thing, because I really do think that Berliner is on to something here. The cost-effectiveness of the total investment in any one student identified as being at risk of falling seriously behind is likely to be far higher providing a huge influx of resources to be used entirely on individualized intervention rather than offering an entire extra year of education overall and repeating a specific grade.\n\nThe logistics of supporting this kind of intervention with anything but local or private revenue is causing my brain to do mental gymnastics, but the complexity might really be worth the benefits.\n\n[Social promotion]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_promotion\n[do better academically]: http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/edfp.2007.2.4.319\n[research section of the Wikipedia page on grade retention]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_retention#Research\n[article about social promotion]: http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/socialpromotion/intro.html\n[The Atlantic]: http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/02/closing-the-literacy-gap-the-trouble-with-holding-back-students/253065/\n[David Berliner]: https://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/28597\n[evidence]: http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/charter_school_strategies.pdf\n[MATCH Charter School's]: http://www.matchschool.org/\n[Houston Independent School District's]: http://www.houstonisd.org/\n[Apollo 20]: http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=436bcd7298b69210VgnVCM10000028147fa6RCRD\n[Fryer]: http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer\n\n[^1]: An aside for another day. \n[^2]: ending social promotion based on standardized assessments offers pretty much a textbook example of regression discontinuity studies, which I think is kind of cool\n[^3]:  Although woefully outdated and using a source from 1986, the [research section of the Wikipedia page on grade retention][]Â outlines this in effective and simple language\n[^4]: I did find the article after I wrote this post\n[^5]: And on her blog, The Educated Reporter\n[^6]:  Of course there is lot of past research to support this idea, but I do think that [Fryer][]'s Apollo 20 evaluation has reinvigorated discussion around the effectiveness of this type of intervention in the past several months. \n[^7]:  In theory, at least.

Renovations, at this point, are likely to be very expensive, although [environmental advocates][] and [businessmen][] alike should unite around refurbishing over [new construction][].\n\nDowntown Providence [^downcity] has no shortage of [vacant space][]. Saving 111 Westminster is going to take creative thinking and substantial investment. Fortunately, there is no better time since the [Arcade is undergoing some exciting changes][]. [^arcade]\n\nBecause of the near perfect alignment of 111 Westminster and the Arcade,\nI'd love to see some true, deep collaboration that rethinks the area on\nWestminster Street between Exchange and Dorrance Streets [^dorrance]. Activating this space at the street level will be a huge boon to the Arcade, 111 Westminster, and the success of Downtown as a whole. I've got a handful of ideas, but I lack the skills to make beautiful pictures to make my visions tangible.\n\nSo I'm going to just have to hope that [Greater City: Providence][] recognizes this as the opportunity for a new [Reboot][], my personal favorite work on the site. In their words,\n\n> **REBOOT** is an occasional series of posts on *Greater City:\n> Providence* where we identify areas of the city that display poor\n> urbanism and propose ways to improve them. Our interventions may be\n> simple and quite easily realized, or they may at times be grand and\n> possibly take years or decades to complete. Either way, we hope they\n> generate interest and discussion.\n\nPast Reboot's have featured the [Providence Train Station][] and [Olneyville Square][], among others. Let's Reboot 111 Westminster and the Arcade, and the whole area east of Dorrance [^110west].\n\n*The original title of this post was unintentionally, overly similar to GCPVD's post on this issue. I recognized this oversight independently and have edited the title.*\n\n\n[has chosen to leave]: http://www.pbn.com/Bank-of-America-to-vacate-Superman-building-,64983\n[environmental advocates]: http://www.theatlanticcities.com/housing/2012/01/why-most-environmental-building-building-weve-already-built/1016/\n[businessmen]: http://chronicle.com/blogs/buildings/costume-jewelry-factory-will-become-browns-medical-school-saving-35-million/26293\n[new construction]: http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2011/11/21/195_redevelopment.JPG\n[vacant space]: http://www.pbn.com/2011-turning-point-for-commercial-real-estate,63603?category_id=79&sub_type=stories,packages\n[Arcade is undergoing some exciting changes]: http://www.gcpvd.org/2012/01/20/the-arcade-are-you-kidding-me-with-this/\n[Greater City: Providence]: http://www.gcpvd.org\n[Reboot]: http://www.gcpvd.org/category/features/reboot/\n[Providence Train Station]: http://www.gcpvd.org/2011/06/08/reboot-providence-train-station/\n[Olneyville Square]: http://www.gcpvd.org/2010/08/17/reboot-olneyville-square/\n\n[^downcity]: I am desperately trying to drop \"Downcity\" in favor of \"Downtown\" after training myself to say Downcity.\n[^arcade]: I know I've been cranky about the Arcade plans, but I think that's more about my general mood than the merits of the redevelopment.

				"content_html": "<p>The past few months I&rsquo;ve been learning how to use R. This morning, I decided to try out two first&ndash; importing a table of data that is being read of the web and overlaying location data onto a map.</p>\n\n<p>With a little bit of Google skills and just enough R know-how I was able to produce this image:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2020/dba5161e87.png\" alt=\"Homesales\" title=\"homesales.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n\n<p>There were a few things that were kind of tricky for me. First, for sometime I couldn&rsquo;t get latitude and longitude components for the addresses. I figured there was something wrong with the way I was using the *apply class of functions in R. apply() (and the related class of functions lapply, sapply, etc.) are really handy if a bit tricky for beginning R users. This function permits quickly &ldquo;applying&rdquo; a function across multiple elements. Traditionally this is done with a loop, but the apply() functions &ldquo;vectorize&rdquo; this process (R folks always talk about making your code more vectorized which has something to do with the structure of objects in R but is beyond my computer science skills&ndash; essentially, vectorized code runs much faster and more efficiency than loops because of some underlying feature of the language). After playing around with apply, lapply, and sapply, I decided to move back into my &ldquo;old&rdquo; way of thinking and just write a loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">latlongroll &lt;- function(address){\n  lat &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;numeric&quot;, length = length(address))\n  lng &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;numeric&quot;, length = length(address))\n  for(i in 1:length(address)){\n    latlong &lt;- gGeoCode(address[i])\n    lat[i]&lt;-latlong[1]\n    lng[i]&lt;-latlong[2]\n  }\n  return(cbind(lat,lng))\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This still didn&rsquo;t work&ndash; I kept on getting a strange out-of-bounds call. So I decided to go down the rabbit hole of regular expressions and try and see if I could clean up my addresses any further (I couldn&rsquo;t). So, now seemed as good a time as any to figure out how to print to the console while a loop is running to keep track of progress and where exactly my function was stopped. This turned out to be a bit tricky because I didn&rsquo;t know you had to include a tricky line, <code>r flush.console()</code> in order to get the prints to work. When I figured this out I found out my loop was being caught on my 7th element, a perfectly well formed address. When I ran gGeoCode() on that address only it worked fine. So I thought, maybe Google is bouncing me out because I&rsquo;m hitting it too fast? And bingo, the final (working version):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-r\">latlongroll &lt;- function(address){\n lat &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;numeric&quot;, length = length(address))\n lng &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;numeric&quot;, length = length(address))\n for(i in 1:length(address)){\n  print(i)\n  flush.console()\n  latlong &lt;- gGeoCode(address[i])\n  lat[i]&lt;-latlong[1]\n  lng[i]&lt;-latlong[2]\n  Sys.sleep(0.5)\n }\n return(cbind(lat,lng))\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Other than that, the whole process was pretty straight forward. I have to thank Tony Breyal for <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3257441/geocoding-in-r-with-google-maps\">posting the functions I used</a> to get latitude and longitude on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>.

				"content_text": "\nThe past few months I've been learning how to use R. This morning, I decided to try out two first-- importing a table of data that is being read of the web and overlaying location data onto a map.\n\nWith a little bit of Google skills and just enough R know-how I was able to produce this image:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2020/dba5161e87.png\" alt=\"Homesales\" title=\"homesales.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" />\n\nThere were a few things that were kind of tricky for me. First, for sometime I couldn't get latitude and longitude components for the addresses. I figured there was something wrong with the way I was using the \\*apply class of functions in R. apply() (and the related class of functions lapply, sapply, etc.) are really handy if a bit tricky for beginning R users. This function permits quickly \"applying\" a function across multiple elements. Traditionally this is done with a loop, but the apply() functions \"vectorize\" this process (R folks always talk about making your code more vectorized which has something to do with the structure of objects in R but is beyond my computer science skills-- essentially, vectorized code runs much faster and more efficiency than loops because of some underlying feature of the language). After playing around with apply, lapply, and sapply, I decided to move back into my \"old\" way of thinking and just write a loop:\n\n```r\nlatlongroll <- function(address){\n  lat <- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = length(address))\n  lng <- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = length(address))\n  for(i in 1:length(address)){\n    latlong <- gGeoCode(address[i])\n    lat[i]<-latlong[1]\n    lng[i]<-latlong[2]\n  }\n  return(cbind(lat,lng))\n} \n```\n\nThis still didn't work-- I kept on getting a strange out-of-bounds call. So I decided to go down the rabbit hole of regular expressions and try and see if I could clean up my addresses any further (I couldn't). So, now seemed as good a time as any to figure out how to print to the console while a loop is running to keep track of progress and where exactly my function was stopped. This turned out to be a bit tricky because I didn't know you had to include a tricky line, `r flush.console()` in order to get the prints to work. When I figured this out I found out my loop was being caught on my 7th element, a perfectly well formed address. When I ran gGeoCode() on that address only it worked fine. So I thought, maybe Google is bouncing me out because I'm hitting it too fast? And bingo, the final (working version):\n\n```r\nlatlongroll <- function(address){\n lat <- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = length(address))\n lng <- vector(mode = \"numeric\", length = length(address))\n for(i in 1:length(address)){\n  print(i)\n  flush.console()\n  latlong <- gGeoCode(address[i])\n  lat[i]<-latlong[1]\n  lng[i]<-latlong[2]\n  Sys.sleep(0.5)\n }\n return(cbind(lat,lng))\n}\n```\n\nOther than that, the whole process was pretty straight forward. I have to thank Tony Breyal for [posting the functions I used][] to get latitude and longitude on [Stack Overflow][]. Also, I found the [RgoogleMaps vignette][] to be very helpful, although I wish it had slightly better explained what was going on in qbbox().\n\nFinally, my full source for the above:\n\n```r\n# Providence Real Estate Transactions over the last 40 days.\n# Required Packages\nrequire('XML')\nrequire('RCurl')\nrequire('RJSONIO')\nrequire(\"RgoogleMaps\")\n# Functions\n# Construct URL required to get the Lat and Long from Google Maps\nconstruct.geocode.url <- function(address, return.call = \"json\", sensor = \"false\"   ) {\n root <- \"[maps.google.com/maps/api/...](http://maps.google.com/maps/api/geocode/)\"\n u <- paste(root, return.call, \"?address=\", address, \"&sensor=\", sensor, sep = \"\"   )\n return(URLencode(u))\n}\n# Now that we have the proper Google Maps address, get the resulting latitude     and longitude\ngGeoCode <- function(address) {\n u <- construct.geocode.url(address)\n doc <- getURL(u)\n x <- fromJSON(doc,simplify = FALSE)\n lat <- x$results[[1]]$geometry$location$lat\n lng <- x$results[[1]]$geometry$location$lng\n return(c(lat, lng))\n}\n# Roll through addresses to create lat long\nlatlongroll <- function(address){\n# Initializing the length of a vector dramatically speeds up the code.

				"title": "Associated Press: Israeli schools not looking so good against OECD peers.",
				"content_html": "<p>I read an interesting <a href=\"http://goo.gl/SSY83\">article</a> this morning on Israeli\nschools. Facing extreme poverty among Arab-Israeli&rsquo;s and the\nultra-orthodox, Israel struggles to maintain three separate school\nsystems and succeed. It reminded me of some interesting centralized\npolicy reforms in Israel that have led to great natural experiments. For\nexample, so-called Maimonides Laws which capped class sizes at 40,\nallowed for some really interesting regression-discontinuity studies on\nthe impact of class size <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:classsize\"><a href=\"#fn:classsize\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>What I found most interesting in this article, however, was the point\nmade by Jon Medved:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>While agreeing Israeli schools need to raise their standards,\ntechnology entrepreneur Jon Medved doesn&rsquo;t think Israel&rsquo;s test scores\ntell the whole story. He says informal education, through the\nmilitary, youth movements, and extracurricular activities, builds\nskills. He also praised programs for gifted children.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, Medved says he isn&rsquo;t worried that Israel&rsquo;s tech-driven\neconomy will slide because of deficiencies in the school system.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;While I think it&rsquo;s important to sound alarm signals, I haven&rsquo;t heard\nfrom tech companies &hellip; &lsquo;the employees we&rsquo;re getting are not\neducated,&lsquo;&rdquo; Medved said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two thoughts came to mind. First, we certainly are hearing in the United\nStates that employers are unhappy with the caliber of candidates for\nopen positions.

				"content_text": "\nI read an interesting [article][] this morning on Israeli\nschools. Facing extreme poverty among Arab-Israeli's and the\nultra-orthodox, Israel struggles to maintain three separate school\nsystems and succeed. It reminded me of some interesting centralized\npolicy reforms in Israel that have led to great natural experiments. For\nexample, so-called Maimonides Laws which capped class sizes at 40,\nallowed for some really interesting regression-discontinuity studies on\nthe impact of class size [^classsize].\n\nWhat I found most interesting in this article, however, was the point\nmade by Jon Medved:\n\n> While agreeing Israeli schools need to raise their standards,\n> technology entrepreneur Jon Medved doesn't think Israel's test scores\n> tell the whole story. He says informal education, through the\n> military, youth movements, and extracurricular activities, builds\n> skills. He also praised programs for gifted children.\n> \n> Consequently, Medved says he isn't worried that Israel's tech-driven\n> economy will slide because of deficiencies in the school system.\n>\n> \"While I think it's important to sound alarm signals, I haven't heard\n> from tech companies ... 'the employees we're getting are not\n> educated,'\" Medved said.\n\nTwo thoughts came to mind. First, we certainly are hearing in the United\nStates that employers are unhappy with the caliber of candidates for\nopen positions. It's unclear that in the US this is a result of low\naggregate skills or just tremendous mismatch between the skills that are\nattained and the skills that are now valued in the marketplace. Second,\nIsrael's universal military service provides several additional years of\nintense training and skill attainment even before college.

Do we believe that those who were employed as recently as one year ago, already deep into the economic downturn, who do not have a high school diploma fall into the low or high skilled group? It seems obvious to me that if you were employable 59 weeks ago you would almost certainly be in the upper half (if not higher) of the skills distribution among those who don&rsquo;t have high school diplomas. So the result of the GED policy is likely going to lead to no benefit for these workers and will probably even decrease their earnings since they will have some costs associated with earning the GED&ndash; be it the fee for a course, the fee to take the test, the opportunity costs associated with spending time studying and working toward a credential that has no benefit, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Worse, by dramatically changing the contexts where folks earn a GED, we&rsquo;re likely to completely change what signal the GED will send future employers.

				"content_html": "<p>I love that Providence is pursuing a streetcar. There are really just\ntwo things I don&rsquo;t understand about the <a href=\"http://providencecoreconnector.com/\">Core Connector</a>&rsquo;s proposal.\nI&rsquo;m going to tackle one in this post.</p>\n\n<p>Why is the entire streetcar route shared with general traffic with no\ndedicated right-of-way? Truthfully, this isn&rsquo;t a massive issue except in\nthe core part of Downcity where there is substantial traffic during rush\nhours along the street car route. But this makes the plan even more\nperplexing because it&rsquo;s precisely this portion of the route where an\nobvious solution for dedicated light rail ROW exists- Westminster\nStreet.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/Route-November-3.png\" alt=\"Quick and dirty Core Connector modification\" title=\"CoreConnectorRouteModified\" /></p>\n\n<p>The red route above represents the proposed streetcar line. The green\nline represents Westminster Street, a narrow, single lane, one-way\nstreet that cuts through Downcity and in front of <a href=\"http://suraprovidence.com/\">restaurants</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.queenofheartsandmodernlove.com/\">boutique</a> <a href=\"http://www.shopwarf.com\">shopping</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uri.edu/prov/\">URI</a>, etc. It brings the streetcar line\nslightly closer to Johnson and Wales and slightly further from the\nDunkin Donuts Arena and Rhode Island Convention Center. While there is\nreal automobile traffic, this is almost entirely for two reasons. First,\nWestminster has substantial on-street metered parking. Second,\nWestminster is the East-&gt;West one-way to counter Weybosset&rsquo;s West-East.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the two major Downcity planning projects underway are\nremoving the stress that leads to both of these uses. The Downtown\nCirculator project is nearly complete, converting Empire and Weybosset\nto two-way streets. Automobile traffic will almost certainly take the\nwider and faster Washington and Weybosset Streets, adjacent to\nWestminster, unless the goal is to find on the street parking. The\nsecond project is the Core Connector itself, which provides more options\nto get into Downcity without a car, hopefully reducing the need for\nparking. There are also substantial parking capacity that&rsquo;s\nunderutilized in the many surface lots and parking garages in the area.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, there is really no need for Westminster to have\nstreet traffic. A dedicated ROW will increase the speed and\npredictability of the streetcar. Additional pedestrian space along\nWestminster could quickly be used by the cafes and restaurants and\nstreet vendors that already are in the area. The only reason I could\ncome up with for not using Westminster as a dedicated right-of-way for\nthe streetcar is the need for a turn in or around Kennedy Plaza. There\nare so many options for moving between Washington and Westminster that I\njust can&rsquo;t buy this as an insurmountable challenge.</p>\n\n<p>I was unable to make it to the three recent public meetings about the\nproposed route.

There are really just\ntwo things I don't understand about the [Core Connector][]'s proposal.\nI'm going to tackle one in this post.\n\nWhy is the entire streetcar route shared with general traffic with no\ndedicated right-of-way? Truthfully, this isn't a massive issue except in\nthe core part of Downcity where there is substantial traffic during rush\nhours along the street car route. But this makes the plan even more\nperplexing because it's precisely this portion of the route where an\nobvious solution for dedicated light rail ROW exists- Westminster\nStreet.\n\n![Quick and dirty Core Connector modification][]\n\nThe red route above represents the proposed streetcar line. The green\nline represents Westminster Street, a narrow, single lane, one-way\nstreet that cuts through Downcity and in front of [restaurants][],\n[boutique][] [shopping][], [URI][], etc. It brings the streetcar line\nslightly closer to Johnson and Wales and slightly further from the\nDunkin Donuts Arena and Rhode Island Convention Center. While there is\nreal automobile traffic, this is almost entirely for two reasons. First,\nWestminster has substantial on-street metered parking. Second,\nWestminster is the East-\\>West one-way to counter Weybosset's West-East.\n\nOf course, the two major Downcity planning projects underway are\nremoving the stress that leads to both of these uses. The Downtown\nCirculator project is nearly complete, converting Empire and Weybosset\nto two-way streets. Automobile traffic will almost certainly take the\nwider and faster Washington and Weybosset Streets, adjacent to\nWestminster, unless the goal is to find on the street parking. The\nsecond project is the Core Connector itself, which provides more options\nto get into Downcity without a car, hopefully reducing the need for\nparking. There are also substantial parking capacity that's\nunderutilized in the many surface lots and parking garages in the area.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there is really no need for Westminster to have\nstreet traffic. A dedicated ROW will increase the speed and\npredictability of the streetcar. Additional pedestrian space along\nWestminster could quickly be used by the cafes and restaurants and\nstreet vendors that already are in the area. The only reason I could\ncome up with for not using Westminster as a dedicated right-of-way for\nthe streetcar is the need for a turn in or around Kennedy Plaza. There\nare so many options for moving between Washington and Westminster that I\njust can't buy this as an insurmountable challenge.\n\nI was unable to make it to the three recent public meetings about the\nproposed route. If I were there, this would certainly be my first\nquestion.\n\n\n[Core Connector]: http://providencecoreconnector.com/\n[Quick and dirty Core Connector modification]: /img/Route-November-3.png\n  \"CoreConnectorRouteModified\"\n[restaurants]: http://suraprovidence.com/\n[boutique]: http://www.queenofheartsandmodernlove.com/\n[shopping]: http://www.shopwarf.com\n[URI]: http://www.uri.edu/prov/\n\n",

The official route and payment options have now been proposed, as reported in the <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/STREETCAR_PLAN_09-26-11_UAQI5KV_v15.6c71c.html\">Projo</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"route\">Route</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to see that they prioritized frequent service through the main ridership areas (College Hill to Jewelry District and hospital) were prioritized over service to the train station. Jef Nickerson says it best over at <a href=\"http://www.gcpvd.org/2011/09/26/streetcars-the-train-station-is-out-but-thats-ok/\">GCPVD</a>&ndash; the train station is out-of-the-way and would dramatically increase rider time while having unclear implications for ridership, and the station is already very well served (and could easily be better served) by existing bus routes. The streetcar is really about moving people within Providence and providing a permanency to the connectivity between the current (Brown and hospital) and hopefully future (Jewelry District) economic engines of the city.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed route uses Washington and Empire Street&ndash; both are wise choices. Washington Street adds the <a href=\"http://www.providencebiltmore.com/\">Biltmore</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lupos.com/\">Lupos</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uri.edu/prov/\">URI</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.as220.org/about/the-mercantile-block.html\">AS220</a> directly to the route while keeping the <a href=\"http://www.riconvention.com/\">Convention Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dunkindonutscenter.com/\">Dunk</a> near by. Washington also has the advantage of a direct route over 95 for a possible South-Westward expansion in the future with limited cost and slow downs due to a lack of turns. Empire Street is also a great choice. The road is only about to undergo construction to be expanded for two-way traffic (one of the last legs of the Downtown Circulator project). The corner of Washington and Empire anchors the streetcar at the <a href=\"http://www.provlib.org/\">Providence Central Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trinityrep.com/\">Trinity Rep</a>, <a href=\"http://www.as220.org\">AS220</a>, <a href=\"http://38studios.com/\">38 Studios</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/economy/HASBRO_LASALLE_SQUARE_07-19-11_EMP8O4D_v19.42183.html\">Hasbro&rsquo;s new Downcity location</a>. Regency Plaza adds more residential ridership and the massive parking lot across from the Hilton suddenly looks more attractive for infill development. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that I live at Westminster and Empire and would be excellently served by this location. Overall, I believe this path through Downcity is the easiest to manage while anchoring the streetcar near major hubs of activity. I only wish they could have found a way to bring the streetcar down Westminster and close the street to personal vehicle traffic, but that was never a likely option.</p>\n\n<p>The Jewelry District part of the route never seemed as controversial to me because there were limited solutions that  were somewhat obvious. The decision to use Chestnut makes sense and solidifies the Westminster-Chestnut Street path as a strong North-South connector through the area. Not going all the way to Prairie Avenue is likely going to anger some Upper South Providence residents, but I&rsquo;m not convinced this is a bad thing. At the <a href=\"http://blog.jasonpbecker.com/2011/09/08/community-voice-at-the-knowledge-district-development-framework-meeting/\">Knowledge District Development Framework meeting</a> it was clear that increasing paucity between the two sides of Prairie Avenue was a major goal of development in the hospital area. Forcing people to walk a bit on Dudley Street may generate the kind of foot traffic needed to make infill in that area with first floor retail a lot more attractive.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-tax\">The Tax</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of it. This one is a no-brainer in my mind. Property values will certainly increase in the areas being served by the streetcar and therefore current owners stand to have some significant gains in equity if this project moves forward. The attractiveness of living where I am has increased tremendously for Brown faculty and staff, medical students, and some of the entrepreneurs and their employees if they ever materialize in the Jewelry District. That I should have to contribute some of this gained equity back to get the project built makes sense. The question is, will the requested tax be too high to be worth it? So let&rsquo;s do the math. The proposal will hit me with \\$0.95 on every \\$1,000 of property value. Let&rsquo;s assume that the homestead exemption will not be applied to this tax. Let&rsquo;s also assume that I&rsquo;m looking at a 15 year stay Downcity. This is reasonable because most of the properties around here are condos that are one or two bedroom and are not attractive to\nfolks with families&ndash; we&rsquo;re filled with young folks and empty-nesters who aren&rsquo;t likely to be looking at this like a 30 year investment. Let&rsquo;s also assume that the economy will continue to stagnate over this period so we only see an inflation rate of, say, 2%. It&rsquo;s likely that this is an overly pessimistic estimate that will increase the cost. What I&rsquo;m interested in is the present discounted value, or the cost to me due to this tax if I were to incur it all up front. The theory goes that money today is worth more than money tomorrow because money depreciates in value due to inflation and because money today can be invested and will grow over time. We calculate PDV much like you would calculate compound interest. The final piece of data to calculate the PDV needed is my home value. Let&rsquo;s assume it hasn&rsquo;t moved at all since I purchased about a year ago, which would peg my condo at \\$168,000. Now I want to know if\nthe PDV of the tax will exceed what I believe is a reasonable estimate for the increase in equity I will realize because of the project.\nAnd the PDV is&hellip;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\\$2,050.74</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it would be hard to argue that my property value won&rsquo;t increase at least 1.2% because of this project. Adding the line, &ldquo;Steps to the Providence Streetcar that will take you to Brown&rsquo;s Medical School, through the Knowledge District, and to the Hospitals or through Downcity to RISD and Brown,&rdquo; is going to be worth more than that, period. I can&rsquo;t imagine the calculus is dramatically different for other Downcity property owners which means for us, this makes &ldquo;cents&rdquo;.</p>\n",

At the [Knowledge District Development Framework meeting][] it was clear that increasing paucity between the two sides of Prairie Avenue was a major goal of development in the hospital area. Forcing people to walk a bit on Dudley Street may generate the kind of foot traffic needed to make infill in that area with first floor retail a lot more attractive.\n\n## The Tax\n\nI'm in favor of it. This one is a no-brainer in my mind. Property values will certainly increase in the areas being served by the streetcar and therefore current owners stand to have some significant gains in equity if this project moves forward. The attractiveness of living where I am has increased tremendously for Brown faculty and staff, medical students, and some of the entrepreneurs and their employees if they ever materialize in the Jewelry District. That I should have to contribute some of this gained equity back to get the project built makes sense. The question is, will the requested tax be too high to be worth it? So let's do the math. The proposal will hit me with \\$0.95 on every \\$1,000 of property value. Let's assume that the homestead exemption will not be applied to this tax. Let's also assume that I'm looking at a 15 year stay Downcity. This is reasonable because most of the properties around here are condos that are one or two bedroom and are not attractive to\nfolks with families-- we're filled with young folks and empty-nesters who aren't likely to be looking at this like a 30 year investment. Let's also assume that the economy will continue to stagnate over this period so we only see an inflation rate of, say, 2%. It's likely that this is an overly pessimistic estimate that will increase the cost. What I'm interested in is the present discounted value, or the cost to me due to this tax if I were to incur it all up front. The theory goes that money today is worth more than money tomorrow because money depreciates in value due to inflation and because money today can be invested and will grow over time. We calculate PDV much like you would calculate compound interest. The final piece of data to calculate the PDV needed is my home value. Let's assume it hasn't moved at all since I purchased about a year ago, which would peg my condo at \\$168,000. Now I want to know if\nthe PDV of the tax will exceed what I believe is a reasonable estimate for the increase in equity I will realize because of the project. \nAnd the PDV is...\n\n> **\\$2,050.74**\n\nI think it would be hard to argue that my property value won't increase at least 1.2% because of this project. Adding the line, \"Steps to the Providence Streetcar that will take you to Brown's Medical School, through the Knowledge District, and to the Hospitals or through Downcity to RISD and Brown,\" is going to be worth more than that, period. I can't imagine the calculus is dramatically different for other Downcity property owners which means for us, this makes \"cents\".\n\n[Providence's Core Connector Study]: http://providencecoreconnector.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Final-Alternatives-Fact-Sheet.pdf\n[Projo]: http://www.projo.com/news/content/STREETCAR_PLAN_09-26-11_UAQI5KV_v15.6c71c.html\n[GCPVD]: http://www.gcpvd.org/2011/09/26/streetcars-the-train-station-is-out-but-thats-ok/\n[Biltmore]: http://www.providencebiltmore.com/\n[Lupos]: http://www.lupos.com/\n[URI]: http://www.uri.edu/prov/\n[AS220]: http://www.as220.org/about/the-mercantile-block.html\n[Convention Center]: http://www.riconvention.com/\n[Dunk]: http://www.dunkindonutscenter.com/\n[Providence Central Library]: http://www.provlib.org/\n[Trinity Rep]: http://www.trinityrep.com/\n[1]: http://www.as220.org\n[38 Studios]: http://38studios.com/\n[Hasbro's new Downcity location]: http://www.projo.com/economy/HASBRO_LASALLE_SQUARE_07-19-11_EMP8O4D_v19.42183.html\n[Knowledge District Development Framework meeting]: http://blog.jasonpbecker.com/2011/09/08/community-voice-at-the-knowledge-district-development-framework-meeting/\n",

I was a <a href=\"http://hollywoodroaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/maruchan.jpg\">student</a>, and while I&rsquo;ve generally felt that the Macbook Pro/Powerbook have had reasonable economics and a physical\ndesign well beyond their competitors, I just couldn&rsquo;t justify the price to power ratio.

My laptop had totally crapped out on me and I needed a replacement fast. Combining the education discount (which I used a recently expired student ID for), a free printer and iPod, and tax-free weekend in Massachusetts meant I could buy a brand new MBP for around \\$900. Nothing really could compete with this&ndash; the price was right, the battery life, weight, size, and power were all right and I couldn&rsquo;t even\nreach parody with another PC. So I purchased my Macbook Pro.</p>\n\n<p>I was very happy with that laptop. A great keyboard is a must, and the Macbook Pro was the best I used other than my old Thinkpad T43. In addition to the keyboard, I also got a trackpad that was far superior to any I had used before that actually allowed me to ditch the mouse I normally carried with me everywhere I went. The battery life was a\nridiculous 8hrs&ndash; my previous laptop got 2.5hrs at best and I used to think that was an accomplishment. Power wise I never ran into any hiccups. The stability was solid. OSX was easy to adopt to as a full-time OS and I was on my merry way.</p>\n\n<p>Except one, tiny, problem.</p>\n\n<p>I hate using a laptop if I don&rsquo;t have to. Whenever I was home I plugged right into a much bigger screen, an external keyboard, and mouse and sat a desk to use my computer. Call me old-fashioned, but I have never been as comfortable working on a laptop as I am using a separate keyboard, mouse, and monitor. And laptop speakers? Don&rsquo;t even get me started.</p>\n\n<p>Now none of this would be a problem because I used my laptop on the go. At the time I purchased my machine, I was just coming off of five years of school, during which I constantly worked in libraries, coffee shops, friends houses, etc. I also had worked as a consultant at several places over the past year, so bringing my workstation with me on the go was a\nnecessity. One month after I got my laptop, I was working a normal desk job but was assigned a desktop from the stone age that was barely functional. I found myself doing a significant amount of my work on my personal laptop that I brought with me from home. But about six months ago, my job purchased me a new desktop that was blazing fast. I work with confidential data virtually all day long, which was a huge hassle when I used an old machine. I often performed various data management activities with no more than one application open on my work computer, prepare the data in non-confidential format, and ship it off to my laptop for more in-depth analysis. The workflow was atrocious. Having a\nfunctional desktop made it pointless to bring my laptop to work&ndash; most of what I do couldn&rsquo;t be done on a personal machine anyway. So while my workflow became much more efficient, my laptop lost utility. More and more I found myself simply leaving my laptop plugged in at my desk at home and operating it like a desktop. Fast forward to today and I fried\nmy battery, which now holds only 3-4 hours of charge and I haven&rsquo;t used my laptop as a portable computer in months.</p>\n\n<p>I decided I should sell my laptop and replace it with a Mac Mini, which brings me to the title of this post. Perhaps the most pleasant experience I&rsquo;ve had on any computer since I first used a Gateway 2000 c. 1992 came from using Apple&rsquo;s Migration Assistant. Upon turning on my Mac Mini for the first time, the setup wizard offered  the opportunity to transfer files and settings from another computer. Now this is a feature that browsers and other software have offered for years and the experience has never been all that useful to me. But this time I decided\nto try it and I plugged my laptop into my Mac Mini using an ethernet cable. Approximate 2 hours later my Mac Mini restarted and the experience was breathtaking.</p>\n\n<p>Everything, and I mean everything, transferred over to my new computer. All my applications were installed. All of my settings, including those made by software like Onyx and Geek Tool, transferred over. All my documents were where I left them. The experience was indistinguishable from logging onto my laptop.</p>\n\n<p>This is an astonishingly great and useful feature. It seems so simple in theory, but execution can easily be botched. Apple hit a home run with Migration Assistant, at least as of the version that comes standard in\nLion.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, my experience with Migration Assistant, along with the great resale value on my Macbook Pro, has pretty much ensured that my next computer will be an Apple.</p>\n",

The battery life was a\nridiculous 8hrs-- my previous laptop got 2.5hrs at best and I used to think that was an accomplishment. Power wise I never ran into any hiccups. The stability was solid. OSX was easy to adopt to as a full-time OS and I was on my merry way.\n\nExcept one, tiny, problem.\n\nI hate using a laptop if I don't have to. Whenever I was home I plugged right into a much bigger screen, an external keyboard, and mouse and sat a desk to use my computer. Call me old-fashioned, but I have never been as comfortable working on a laptop as I am using a separate keyboard, mouse, and monitor. And laptop speakers? Don't even get me started.\n\nNow none of this would be a problem because I used my laptop on the go. At the time I purchased my machine, I was just coming off of five years of school, during which I constantly worked in libraries, coffee shops, friends houses, etc. I also had worked as a consultant at several places over the past year, so bringing my workstation with me on the go was a\nnecessity. One month after I got my laptop, I was working a normal desk job but was assigned a desktop from the stone age that was barely functional. I found myself doing a significant amount of my work on my personal laptop that I brought with me from home. But about six months ago, my job purchased me a new desktop that was blazing fast. I work with confidential data virtually all day long, which was a huge hassle when I used an old machine. I often performed various data management activities with no more than one application open on my work computer, prepare the data in non-confidential format, and ship it off to my laptop for more in-depth analysis. The workflow was atrocious. Having a\nfunctional desktop made it pointless to bring my laptop to work-- most of what I do couldn't be done on a personal machine anyway. So while my workflow became much more efficient, my laptop lost utility. More and more I found myself simply leaving my laptop plugged in at my desk at home and operating it like a desktop. Fast forward to today and I fried\nmy battery, which now holds only 3-4 hours of charge and I haven't used my laptop as a portable computer in months.\n\nI decided I should sell my laptop and replace it with a Mac Mini, which brings me to the title of this post. Perhaps the most pleasant experience I've had on any computer since I first used a Gateway 2000 c. 1992 came from using Apple's Migration Assistant. Upon turning on my Mac Mini for the first time, the setup wizard offered  the opportunity to transfer files and settings from another computer. Now this is a feature that browsers and other software have offered for years and the experience has never been all that useful to me. But this time I decided\nto try it and I plugged my laptop into my Mac Mini using an ethernet cable. Approximate 2 hours later my Mac Mini restarted and the experience was breathtaking.\n\nEverything, and I mean everything, transferred over to my new computer. All my applications were installed. All of my settings, including those made by software like Onyx and Geek Tool, transferred over. All my documents were where I left them. The experience was indistinguishable from logging onto my laptop.\n\nThis is an astonishingly great and useful feature. It seems so simple in theory, but execution can easily be botched. Apple hit a home run with Migration Assistant, at least as of the version that comes standard in\nLion.\n\nUltimately, my experience with Migration Assistant, along with the great resale value on my Macbook Pro, has pretty much ensured that my next computer will be an Apple.\n\n[Linux]: http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/6300003.jpg\n[a great CLI]: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png\n[rock hard stability]: http://www.eatliver.com/img/2005/294.jpg\n[Apple tax]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Apple+Tax\n[student]: http://hollywoodroaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/maruchan.jpg\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Tonight, I went to a public meeting run by Providence&rsquo;s Department of Planning and Development. A few of upfront observations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The folks who work for the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) were professional, kind, and capable, as was the consultants who worked with them. They maintained decorum and a genuine sense of openness even though there was a clear tension in the room between some outspoken (and knowledgeable) community members and activists who had clearly participated in many past meetings.</li>\n<li>The ideas presented for the Knowledge District demonstrated thoughtful, albeit top-down, considerations for the space that showed a remarkable respect for the complexity, size, and importance of the project.

In part, maybe this is because they&rsquo;re simply not at that deep a stage. I&rsquo;m hopeful that the purpose of the public meetings was not just to get\nfeedback on the big concepts (which seem largely unassailable), but to make sure they get the details right from the people who live and interact with these neighborhoods daily.</li>\n<li>There are some clear areas of consensus among the engaged community, both positive and negative. At times, this consensus suggest that the state, city, and institutions (business, education, health, etc) have very different goals than the community.\n∫\nHere&rsquo;s my summary of what the community had to say:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Folks want to get rid of surface parking lots and move towards more parking structures. It&rsquo;s very clear that everyone feels these surface lots contribute to the desolate feel of the Jewelry District and hospital area, as well as acting as an extra barrier (beyond the highways) to connecting the Knowledge District to the rest of the city. People want to see mixed-use, with real action on the street level and residences and offices on higher floors. Everyone wants better sight lines to draw people into the Jewelry district and wants to see green space embraced, not solely through a park on the water but intimately placed directly on the streets as trees and other landscaping. People cited Chestnut and Richmond Street  several times as strong streets that acted as the main arteries by which Downcity and the Jewelry District connect. It seems that there is broad agreement that there a reason needs to exist to draw pedestrians into this neighborhood from Downcity, Fox Point, and Upper South Providence if we&rsquo;re going to have a vital, 24/7 community. There was also pretty broad acceptance of higher buildings being constructed along I-95 and keeping large footprint buildings out of the Jewelry District.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the more negative tone of the evening came from two core issues&ndash; the need for more residential development, something that&rsquo;s not seen as high priority or even on the radar of most public officials, and funding. I&rsquo;ll start with funding. There are serious concerns that even if the plans are perfect and great, a total lack of municipal, state, and federal funding for the foreseeable future places major risks on central aspects of the DPD&rsquo;s plans. How can we fund a large, sweeping greenway and inviting, beautiful streets? How can we fund restoring vital roadways absorbed by bad planning in the past? How can we upkeep the parks people crave or build vital family institutions like schools without any public funding? How will we repurpose landmark\nbuildings like the Dynamo House that has sat vacant even though it&rsquo;s so full of potential? There is a serious sense that all the projects that serve as good models for the Knowledge District required considerable public infrastructure investment that&rsquo;s just not available now. Sadly, to truly &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the Knowledge District will require not just one large project, but several major improvements. I saw little optimism for the proposed Streetcar/light rail system that RIPTA is championing. Some of that was disbelief that it could ever be funded, and some of that was disbelief the streetcar was a solution to a real problem. There&rsquo;s also little optimism that the proposed pedestrian bridge to connect Fox Point to the Jewelry District is going to happen. Everyone begrudged that DPD had little real authority to make anything happen. Zoning is an absolute disgrace in Providence, particularly this area. But even substantially improving the zoning and regulations around development won&rsquo;t actually make sure the projects are mindful of the projects wider goals. More to the point, it&rsquo;s still unclear how Providence can simply use the name &ldquo;Knowledge District&rdquo; to bring in the kind of development needed. There is serious consternation that the entire &ldquo;Knowledge District&rdquo; concept is selling something that doesn&rsquo;t exist and won&rsquo;t have the infrastructure to attract folks. Without the promise of big public infrastructure improvements, developers are going to play the &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; game.</p>\n\n<p>Residential development is another important aspect of what the community members craved. It was immediately clear that the desire of folks at this meeting was to have a 24/7 neighborhood with mixed-uses, including several calls (from residents, no less) to include low-income and affordable housing. There is strong dislike of the name &ldquo;Knowledge District&rdquo;, especially if it supplants the Jewelry District (which is a subset of the area in question). No one feels that this name captures what they want to use the space for, and no one felt the name had any\nreal meaning. Folks believed that &ldquo;Knowledge District&rdquo; was as empty marketing that would have no real longterm staying power. But really, this goes beyond a bad name. The members of the community who met with DPD tonight clearly believe that residential development has taken a\nmajor backseat to institutional expansion and large business development. My interpretation was that the community felt that lawmakers were simply hoping that big groups like the hospitals, Brown University, Johnson and Wales, and some yet-to-be-named mid-sized businesses would snap up parcels and build massive buildings that would fill with jobs. First, they believed this vision was largely a fiction (again, see the hesitation folks had that businesses of any remarkable\nsize would take on the development costs and move to Providence without the public infrastructure investments). Second, these kinds of buildings were not what the community envisioned, particularly for the Jewelry District area that already has much smaller plot sizes and lower building heights. What I heard, rather clearly, was that the sea of parking lots around the hospital and the area with raised highway along I-95 was fair game for the behemoth buildings most lawmakers are picturing for the entire project. But the interior of the Knowledge\nDistrict has to be filled in with a place that people want to live, play and work in (in that order).</p>\n\n<p>I hope to write some more on my thoughts on developing this area in the future. I generally agree with the comments from the community above, but I have a bit more optimism and a bit more faith. Overall, I was really happy with how DPD is framing this project.
