The planter looked upon his slaves as children and punished them as such.”\n\n-- From Joe Helm in [Teaching America’s truth](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/08/28/teaching-slavery-schools/), August 28, 2019\n\nIt seems that the [alt-right insult](https://www.ibtimes.com/what-snowflake-origin-insult-alt-right-leaders-who-support-trump-2492485) of just a few years ago now applies more strongly to the right wing itself, which now offers up a call in [hotline](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/virginia-gov-youngkin-promotes-tip-email-for-parents-to-report-teachers/2948440/) for parents who don't like what their children are being taught in school.\n\nAs a kid, I remember watching _Field of Dreams_, and there being absolutely no question about who the heroes were-- not the folks banning books, which was anachronistic in 1989.\n\n{{< youtube ur7pHRRKhV4 >}}\n\nWhat does this all add up to?\n\nA fearful level of anti-intellectualism, a total denial of our own history which can only hault social progress, and endless division and strife as America slides further from its ideals and toward its past.\n\nThe arc of the moral universe is snapping back, and it's hitting way harder than a slap.\n",

Databases talk SQL. Data stores <a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/online-talks/intro-to-ksql-streaming-sql-for-apache-kafka/\">that</a> <a href=\"https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">don&rsquo;t</a> <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/datalake/admin/query-with-sql/\">talk</a> SQL <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-sql\">have</a> SQL interfaces.

And importantly, even if you&rsquo;re not writing SQL directly, SQL&rsquo;s impact means that most APIs for interacting with tabular data borrow from SQL.</p>\n<p>You will see <code>select</code>, <code>where</code>, <code>group by</code>, and <code>* join</code> everywhere. Sometimes there&rsquo;s a word substitution (like <code>dplyr</code> using <code>filter</code> for <code>where</code>), but understanding the basics of a <code>SELECT</code> query in SQL will teach you how to access data anywhere.</p>\n<p>SQL also teaches you about data organization and design by its very nature. By understanding how joins, filters, and aggregations work, you start to understand principles behind good data ways to structure and store data for analytic tasks.</p>\n<p>A day spent writing SQL is almost always a good day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"git\">Git</h3>\n<p>Do you want to understand your code? Do you want others to understand it? The one computer science class I took taught that the way you accomplished this was writing comments. This was wrong. When you change your code, the comments don&rsquo;t change. When you write your comments, they may not actually describe what&rsquo;s happening. Comments have a place, but they are far from your first line of defense.</p>\n<p>First, you should strive to write really obvious, clear code. Use descriptive nouns for all of your variables. Name your functions with descriptive verbs. Don&rsquo;t be clever. It should be obvious what your code is doing simply by reading the code itself.</p>\n<p>But your second line<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> of defense is <code>git</code>, where true documentation lives. Why do we use <code>git</code>? The main reason folks turn to distributed version control is because it makes it easy to work on the same code in the same files as someone else at the same time and make sure you can recombine that work. But the process of writing <code>commit</code> messages means that <code>git</code> can also serve as the <em>best</em>  way to document your code. Think of a <code>commit</code> message as a comment that is specific to a collection of code that can exist throughout multiple files, time stamped, and with author attribution. You can (and should) use a commit message to explain a logical collection of code changes meant to accomplish one goal. The result, combined with cleanly written code, is documentation about who did something, when, and <em>why</em>. Code comments too often simply try and describe an isolated <em>how</em> and end up being some kind of imperative pseudocode that adds very little the code itself doesn&rsquo;t reveal. The limitation of comments living in-line in a single file strongly encourages the wrong behavior. A <code>commit</code> let&rsquo;s the code author define a unit of change and what is accomplished by that unit.</p>\n<p>Git let&rsquo;s you <em>travel through time</em> and see past code and changes as they happen, revert back to known good working state, try out new ways of doing things and easily discard that work, and make huge sweeping changes without ever having fear of finding your &ldquo;last good known state&rdquo;. Have you every edited a long piece of prose, moving around paragraphs and sentences to get things right? Do you paste sentences after a whole bunch of white space at the end of a document or hit undo frantically to try and get back to before you made things work? Git make all that easy for code.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever found a reproducible regression and written a failing test, then gone ahead and used <code>git-bisect</code> to find out exactly which commit broke the behavior, then found a solid commit message explaining what was done and why, you&rsquo;ve known true joy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cli\">CLI</h3>\n<p>The CLI, or command-line interface, is a big area. When I say CLI (and I believe Vicki means the same), I&rsquo;m talking about being proficient with Linux/Unix/POSIX etc style systems. There are two separate reasons I believe in the CLI. The first is Vicki&rsquo;s reason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a data developer, you will spend most of your time SSHing into servers, looking at stuff, and running code.

Databases talk SQL. Data stores [that](https://www.confluent.io/online-talks/intro-to-ksql-streaming-sql-for-apache-kafka/) [don't](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [talk](https://docs.mongodb.com/datalake/admin/query-with-sql/) SQL [have](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-sql) SQL interfaces. You will interact with databases everywhere you go. And importantly, even if you're not writing SQL directly, SQL's impact means that most APIs for interacting with tabular data borrow from SQL.\n\nYou will see `select`, `where`, `group by`, and `* join` everywhere. Sometimes there's a word substitution (like `dplyr` using `filter` for `where`), but understanding the basics of a `SELECT` query in SQL will teach you how to access data anywhere.\n\nSQL also teaches you about data organization and design by its very nature. By understanding how joins, filters, and aggregations work, you start to understand principles behind good data ways to structure and store data for analytic tasks.\n\nA day spent writing SQL is almost always a good day.\n\n### Git\n\nDo you want to understand your code? Do you want others to understand it? The one computer science class I took taught that the way you accomplished this was writing comments. This was wrong. When you change your code, the comments don't change. When you write your comments, they may not actually describe what's happening.

Name your functions with descriptive verbs. Don't be clever.

The main reason folks turn to distributed version control is because it makes it easy to work on the same code in the same files as someone else at the same time and make sure you can recombine that work.

A `commit` let's the code author define a unit of change and what is accomplished by that unit.\n\n[^thirdline]: The third line of defense is writing tests.

Imagine if while we funded expanded unemployment, we also funded states to have better systems for direct deposit access, Postal Service banking to have universal access to consumer banking needs, and dramatically changed the complexity of qualifying for unemployment.\n\nI'm not sure what the equivalent is for rent, but there are clearly systems, capacities, and relationships government simply does not have that makes rent assistance virtually impossible. If we don't like that, we need to fix it for the next crisis.\n\nThe failure of so much leftist, activist politics is a complete disinterest in making government better at its job and caring about the details of governing. We're so busy worrying about ideological purity that fights over actual policy become purely symbolic-- even when you win, it turns out our government cannot do what you want well. \n\nAnd so the cycle begins as the right points out ineptitude as though that's an inevitable, permanent feature of any government action. \n\nWe need to make government work well while we can ask government to do more. It can't be either/or.\n",

				"title": "Changing Careers and Leaving a City Behind is Hard",
				"content_html": "<p>I recently realized how disruptive it was to my personal relationships and professional networks to change fields and then move 375 miles away. I think moving from working in government and research academia, where my work was largely in the open and I could largely discuss the details in public, to the private sector, where I often cannot discuss the details of my work, made this even more difficult.</p>\n<p>I don’t regret this shift; it was 100% the right thing for me and has been an incredible opportunity. But I don’t think I ever realized the strain I have felt because of it. I still don’t have a strong “startup” network. I have no product management network. My Baltimore network is minuscule; it’s virtually non-existent if you remove direct colleagues. These things are my own fault.</p>\n<p>I came to this position having left a community I built by happenstance in the easiest way. I went to college and graduate school in the same city, then I worked in that city, in both city and state in government. I interacted with former classmates or professionals who attended the same undergraduate or graduate program in my daily work and around town. This became a tight network for me. When I started to feel limited by &ldquo;only&rdquo; knowing Providence and Rhode Island folks, I left my role at the state to go back to work at my university (in collaboration with the city school district) through a national fellowship. That fellowship tied me to similar practitioners across the country, and I already knew many people within that network because they were former classmates or colleagues. I basically went to school and did my job and stayed connected to the people I met along the way as they spread out into new cities and new opportunities, none too distant from my own work.</p>\n<p>My friends were mostly folks who I went to school with that stayed around town or folks I interacted with tangentially through work. Staying in Providence for a decade gave me a huge leg up when it came to building a personal and professional network.</p>\n<p>When I moved to Baltimore, I wasn’t a part of any kind of group experience or challenge that allowed me to meet new people. I wasn&rsquo;t in a cohort of &ldquo;founders&rdquo; connected me to the tech community. I wasn&rsquo;t coming together regularly with people who were product managers. I had abandoned government data analysis and leadership, and now, I was working at an early stage start up doing product management. I fell into a new career in a very different industry and after a couple of years left what had become my home city to reduce my own travel and improve my chances at moving up at work <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. As an adult, I lacked the kind of community building that happens when you go to school together, or are trained in a group to work a new role together. The sort of school/job orientation of likeminded folks is not a thing that happens very often around 30. And although I worked for a startup, I joined 1 year in and moved to Baltimore 2.5 years later. So perhaps the most likely analogs like an incubator or subsidized office space with other early stage companies had long passed. The easy(ish) mode version of building a network had passed. Add to this to my ferocious sense of imposter syndrome and general lack of confidence and frankly, I’ve floundered a bit.</p>\n<p>I’m going to be working on all this over the next few years, because it’s gotten past the point of just muscling through it. But I’m sharing my story because it’s change a lot about how I’ve thought about moving for different professional or personal opportunities.

				"content_text": "I recently realized how disruptive it was to my personal relationships and professional networks to change fields and then move 375 miles away. I think moving from working in government and research academia, where my work was largely in the open and I could largely discuss the details in public, to the private sector, where I often cannot discuss the details of my work, made this even more difficult.\n\nI don’t regret this shift; it was 100% the right thing for me and has been an incredible opportunity. But I don’t think I ever realized the strain I have felt because of it. I still don’t have a strong “startup” network. I have no product management network. My Baltimore network is minuscule; it’s virtually non-existent if you remove direct colleagues. These things are my own fault. \n\nI came to this position having left a community I built by happenstance in the easiest way. I went to college and graduate school in the same city, then I worked in that city, in both city and state in government. I interacted with former classmates or professionals who attended the same undergraduate or graduate program in my daily work and around town. This became a tight network for me. When I started to feel limited by \"only\" knowing Providence and Rhode Island folks, I left my role at the state to go back to work at my university (in collaboration with the city school district) through a national fellowship. That fellowship tied me to similar practitioners across the country, and I already knew many people within that network because they were former classmates or colleagues. I basically went to school and did my job and stayed connected to the people I met along the way as they spread out into new cities and new opportunities, none too distant from my own work. \n\nMy friends were mostly folks who I went to school with that stayed around town or folks I interacted with tangentially through work. Staying in Providence for a decade gave me a huge leg up when it came to building a personal and professional network. \n\nWhen I moved to Baltimore, I wasn’t a part of any kind of group experience or challenge that allowed me to meet new people. I wasn't in a cohort of \"founders\" connected me to the tech community. I wasn't coming together regularly with people who were product managers. I had abandoned government data analysis and leadership, and now, I was working at an early stage start up doing product management. I fell into a new career in a very different industry and after a couple of years left what had become my home city to reduce my own travel and improve my chances at moving up at work [^success]. As an adult, I lacked the kind of community building that happens when you go to school together, or are trained in a group to work a new role together. The sort of school/job orientation of likeminded folks is not a thing that happens very often around 30. And although I worked for a startup, I joined 1 year in and moved to Baltimore 2.5 years later. So perhaps the most likely analogs like an incubator or subsidized office space with other early stage companies had long passed. The easy(ish) mode version of building a network had passed. Add to this to my ferocious sense of imposter syndrome and general lack of confidence and frankly, I’ve floundered a bit. \n\nI’m going to be working on all this over the next few years, because it’s gotten past the point of just muscling through it. But I’m sharing my story because it’s change a lot about how I’ve thought about moving for different professional or personal opportunities. It’s made me have a greater appreciation of how things outside of family can tie you to a place, and how even in our highly online world, place-based connections are powerful and matter. So do field/industry connections, and leaving both behind at once without putting in the work to rebuild was brutal. Seven years later, I think I still would have an easier time getting a school district or state department job doing data analysis and research than continuing to be a product manager or start up manager/executive, even though it's further from my current experiences and isn't greatest skillset. It’s also not what I want. So it’s time to put in some work. \n\nHow I might weigh staying somewhere versus chasing an opportunity in a new city has evolved. There's a lot of work that happens outside the office when you go somewhere new, and I screwed up by not doing it.\n\n[^success]: Both of these things happened. I should also be clear, I moved when I moved for other personal reasons. A family emergency coinciding with Elsa leaving her job meant we needed more space at home and fast and that there were advantages to being in a different job market. Although I had considered moving to Baltimore, from \"serious conversations\" to \"we're here\" it was about seven days.\n",
