The setting, idyllic. I spent much of my time while watching this movie fantasizing about a world where you summer in a gorgeous Italian countryside home within a fruit orchard, swimming, riding your bike into town, reading, and playing music, without, of course, the internet.</p>\n\n<p>I was drawn to a few scenes in particular. In our opening, as Oliver (Hammer) pulls up to the villa, he’s exhausted from jet lag and travel and collapses into bed in the late afternoon only to emerge the following morning. I found myself wistful for international travel, knowing that loopy feeling of a long flight with little sleep, walking out into a time that feels all wrong, in a brand new place that feels as foreign as it is. There’s something special about that tired first 24 hours in a new country. It’s a feeling I’ve missed in this long pandemic year.</p>\n\n<p>When Elio (Timothée Chalamet) reveals his feelings to Oliver around a World War I memorial, the camera work is perfect. Looking up and down just like an unsure teenager’s head would bob around as they fearfully reveal a deep truth. Elio and Oliver are set across from each other, far apart as confessions are made, with the camera following their circling of the monument, allowing the monument to obscure them both just as they are out of sight with each other.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this movie is just too long. It’s well-paced, but it’s beauty cannot overcome the fact that I don’t feel the fear, or the heartbreak, or even the elation of the young love. I saw it, but I didn’t feel it, and so <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> was beautiful, but flat.</p>\n\n<p>I wish there were more movies like this one, but I didn’t like this one very much.</p>\n",

In this patriotism, pride in America is connected to how she welcomed those of us with nowhere else to go.

				"content_text": "Amy Coney Barrett doesn’t deserve your defense because of her religion any more than she deserves criticism for it.\n\nOf course, the actual critique is not her religious belief, but her belief that she has a duty to use her position in the courts to impose those beliefs on others.\n\nThe conservative movement talks a lot about patriotism. Their vision of patriotism is celebrating the history of a country whose past reflects their current values. This is not an active patriotism of taking part in the American project today and weaving ourselves in her fabric.\n\nA higher form of patriotism actively participates in the American, small-l, liberal democratic tradition. In this patriotism, pride in America is connected to how she welcomed those of us with nowhere else to go. Her ongoing project and triumphs come from her struggle to build a functioning civil society out of radical pluralism. Patriotism in America is using the civic process to accept and incorporate people of all backgrounds into her body-politic.\n\nI am Jewish, and until recently, I have found safety in America. That safety has been challenged many times in the past, and has, at times been compromised. Patriots view this with shame. Patriots view slavery with shame. They view Jim Crow with shame.

Every moment we celebrate in American political religion is about expansion of our ideals, welcoming new people and new thoughts into our project. Every moment we view with shame is about rejection.\n\nIt is in the context that the pre-accusations that Democrats or \"The Left\" are and will attack Amy Coney Barrett on her religion bring to mind the words of the Bard-- _she doth protest too much_.\n\nIn a now off-cited [law review article](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/527/) written when Barrett was 22, she herself posits that a Catholic judge may not be able to sit impartially over a death penalty case.

But the unfortunate combination of racism and ideal about individual freedoms have commingled into  what at times feels like an insurmountable barrier against positivist action for good.\n\n\n[The Case for Adding 672 Million More Americans](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/one-billion-americans-by-matthew-yglesias-book-excerpt.html):\n\n> If you tripled the population of the United States, adding the new Americans only to the Lower 48 and leaving Alaska and Hawaii intact and unchanged, the main part of America would be only about as dense as France and less than half as dense as Germany.\n\nI probably won't read One Billion Americans, but that's mostly because I find it hard to imagine I'll disagree with any of it.\n\n[What Does Everyone See in Jesse Plemons?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/movies/jesse-plemons.html):\n\n> Plemons can toggle easily between eggheads and dimwits, good guys and bad guys, and it’s almost impossible to describe what he’s doing differently because he doesn’t appear to be doing anything at all.\n\nA fascinating profile of a recent _that guy_ in Hollywood.\n\n[Georgia accused of wrongfully purging nearly 200,000 from voter rolls: report](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/514813-georgia-accused-of-wrongfully-purging-nearly-200000-from-voter-rolls):\n\nAnyone paying attention knows how evil the Georgia's Secretary of State office has been in recent years. Just another reason to be terrified of the fragility of our system.\n\n[Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers’](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/):\n\n> But according to sources with knowledge of this visit, Trump, while standing by Robert Kelly’s grave, turned directly to his father and said, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” \n\nYes, everyone has read or has read a hot take about this story. Here's the essence though-- Trump cannot fathom the existence of sacrifice or altruism. Individuals can only act in self-interest, and any hint otherwise is not just suspect, but a sign of being a \"loser\" or a \"sucker\". Our country is in the hands of someone who doesn't know how to use the word \"our\" unless speaking in the majestic plural.\n\n[Speak no evil: The secret to keeping Connecticut segregated](https://ctmirror.org/category/ct-viewpoints/speak-no-evil-the-secret-to-keeping-connecticut-segregated/):\n\n> One offered that Black people didn’t live here because “they” don’t like rural areas. Or because they can’t afford it. If Will Smith wanted to buy a house in town, he certainly could... Grown men actually argued that there was no segregation here, because the town would welcome the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\n\nNot one person in this story would recognize or understand their actions as racist. They would be appalled if you used that word. And perhaps worse, as a result, not one of them would understand that their actions are a part of an entire system chipping away at Black people in America ever day of their lives in this, 2020. This is the use of that small-d democracy from earlier posts to create a system of oppression and deny it-- to put ones knee on the neck of Black America and then claim that the knee never existed, no matter how many times we've all seen the footage. This is the worst kind of racism, because it is so hard to eradicate even as it is so effective at stopping liberation.\n",

We want all NYC schools students to be able to safely enter classrooms, so we're going to reduce other forms of contact, ramp up schools in a deliberate manner, and then, having shown we can do this safely, re-open other parts of the city again. We're going to show the country that no one responds to crisis like New Yorkers do.\" It would work, and NYC would be better for it.\n",

But then the right coordinates merciless attacks against her, and she just rises above the mountain of shit they sling, with grace, humor, strength, and, importantly, the kind of humility they are desperate to prove does not exist.\n\nWithout the right wing scorched earth campaign against her, I would be waiting 10 years to see if she can build coalitions and pass laws, demonstrating she's more than a charismatic politician. Instead, she's been tested for leadership and she keeps passing the test. \n\nI don’t view her as a freshman congresswoman. The right did that.\n",

It was one of the joys of email, and the joys of leisure time.\n\nI continue this practice somewhat today— if you’re unfortunate enough to be a close friend you probably get some combination of iMessage, Twitter DMs, Instagram messages, or Slack messages about the things I find. But it’s all scattered and sent through highly disruptive mechanism.\n\nI don’t really like to link blog because half the fun is curating who I send things to. And I miss spontaneous groupings of my friends who might like the same things.\n\nI think within all this is an inkling of an idea for a web app/service only useful to me that I’d like to write. If I could collect interesting things in a queue almost like Buffer, and then at a set interval, empty that queue. It would send off a custom email to each person collating the items I selected to share with them. The result is almost a newsletter, but actually a collection of “fun things Jason thought you’d like or would love to talk with you about”.\n\nI think I could maintain a lot more of my friendships with this package. In many ways, sharing the fun stuff I find on the web or debating a news article or blog with you, probably because I thought you’d have interesting things to say or it would challenge your thinking in some way, is my love language.\n",

For the first time, I had a meaningful professional network. I left my first job for all the right reasons. I had learned a lot but could see no opportunities for growth or change on the horizon. My boss would hold his job for at least another 7 and maybe 10 years. I wasn’t sure I’d want his job anyway. I was trusted and respected, and already had opportunities to work in almost all parts of the organization and choose the projects I wanted to contribute to. I had a great job, but it would be that same job forever. Meanwhile, three years out from finishing my undergraduate degree and a couple of years out from graduate school, I saw many of my classmates switching jobs into new and exciting opportunities that they came across through the professional networks they were building. I was building no network— we had no money for professional development, a complete travel ban unless required as a part of a grant, and I worked in a state agency in a small state. It a was hard decision— I did enjoy my job, but I needed to leave to grow.</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e0a0362dce.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:PPAC Square ;description:Downcity Providence is beautiful in the snow.\"\n   \n>\n<img  \n        src = \"https://micro.blog/photos/260x/https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e0a0362dce.jpg\"\n     \n     \n     \n        title=PPAC&#32;Square&#32; \n     \n     style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e24135e38e.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Gracie at my Parents ;description:She finds the top of a couch with a window anywhere that we go.\"\n   \n>\n<img  \n        src = \"https://micro.blog/photos/260x/https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e24135e38e.jpg\"\n     \n     \n     \n        title=Gracie&#32;at&#32;my&#32;Parents&#32; \n     \n     style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f63524ca5e.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Cross-armed Gracie ;description:A classic pose she still does on this same couch.\"\n   \n>\n<img  \n        src = \"https://micro.blog/photos/260x/https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f63524ca5e.jpg\"\n     \n     \n     \n        title=Cross-armed&#32;Gracie&#32; \n     \n     style=\"max-width: 100%\"/>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/137dbf8a52.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2012\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Kayaking ;description:Evidence that at least once, Elsa and I actually went a did something outdoorsy, which we always say we&#39;re going to do.

I left a supportive, if limited, environment and found myself unready for the rigors of independence. I had two bosses in two different organizations, both of whom saw me as self-motivated and self-reliant, My work was largely long term projects. I went from working in a cubicle on many small projects always on a team to working alone in a quiet office or from home if I chose to do so. While I had a professional community through my fellowship, in many ways, my daily professional life was quiet and lonely. I made steady progress but had a hard time building day to day motivation. I had long thought I might get a Ph.D., but it became horrifyingly clear that managing an independent, long term research project was draining, not invigorating. I enjoyed teaching and being a part of an academic community, but I knew the long odds of getting a tenure track position. Now joining academia not only seemed unobtainable but also undesirable. What was I going to do?</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/39e50da5a0.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2013\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Bed and Breakfast Murder Mystery;description:We dressed up for a winter weekend bed and breakfast murder mystery experience.

I met my future boss, mentor, and a dear friend through a chance encounter 2000 miles from home. During my interview, Jess told me she saw “C-level potential” in me.

I turned 30, and I started to take working out more seriously because years of work travel and neglect made me feel bad. I wanted to get back some of the healthy habits I had built a few years prior when Elsa and I both lost a fair amount of weight. Allovue&rsquo;s CTO Ted left, and I was put in charge of development in addition to design, product management, and data integration. Although we weathered that initial transition well, I think it&rsquo;s only in 2019 that I truly began to feel comfortable with my new role. We also released our first version of our Budget tool, our second major software product. We bought our house in Hampden, Baltimore. For the first time, we have enough room for family and friends to visit and stay with us and we can host holidays. I love our new home and we&rsquo;re building a nice life here. Some of my heart remains in Providence, but Baltimore is nudging its way in. I still don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;ve built the strong emotional ties to Baltimore I had for Providence, but I&rsquo;d like to get there someday.</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n<a href=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/85ec08e231.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   \n     data-gallery=\"2017\"\n   \n   \n     data-glightbox=\"title:Chilaquiles;description:The best chilaquiles I&#39;ve ever eaten.

For the first time, I had a meaningful professional network. I left my first job for all the right reasons. I had learned a lot but could see no opportunities for growth or change on the horizon. My boss would hold his job for at least another 7 and maybe 10 years. I wasn’t sure I’d want his job anyway. I was trusted and respected, and already had opportunities to work in almost all parts of the organization and choose the projects I wanted to contribute to. I had a great job, but it would be that same job forever. Meanwhile, three years out from finishing my undergraduate degree and a couple of years out from graduate school, I saw many of my classmates switching jobs into new and exciting opportunities that they came across through the professional networks they were building. I was building no network— we had no money for professional development, a complete travel ban unless required as a part of a grant, and I worked in a state agency in a small state. It a was hard decision— I did enjoy my job, but I needed to leave to grow.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e0a0362dce.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"PPAC Square \" description=\"Downcity Providence is beautiful in the snow.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/e24135e38e.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"Gracie at my Parents \" description=\"She finds the top of a couch with a window anywhere that we go.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f63524ca5e.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"Cross-armed Gracie \" description=\"A classic pose she still does on this same couch.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/137dbf8a52.jpg\" gallery=\"2012\" title=\"Kayaking \" description=\"Evidence that at least once, Elsa and I actually went a did something outdoorsy, which we always say we're going to do.

I left a supportive, if limited, environment and found myself unready for the rigors of independence. I had two bosses in two different organizations, both of whom saw me as self-motivated and self-reliant, My work was largely long term projects. I went from working in a cubicle on many small projects always on a team to working alone in a quiet office or from home if I chose to do so. While I had a professional community through my fellowship, in many ways, my daily professional life was quiet and lonely. I made steady progress but had a hard time building day to day motivation. I had long thought I might get a Ph.D., but it became horrifyingly clear that managing an independent, long term research project was draining, not invigorating. I enjoyed teaching and being a part of an academic community, but I knew the long odds of getting a tenure track position. Now joining academia not only seemed unobtainable but also undesirable. What was I going to do?\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/39e50da5a0.jpg\" gallery=\"2013\" title=\"Bed and Breakfast Murder Mystery\" description=\"We dressed up for a winter weekend bed and breakfast murder mystery experience.

I still can’t quite believe the series of events that conspired to put us in a room together that day, for me to ask a conference panel a question, for her to hand me her card, and for me to know just enough to realize that a once in a lifetime opportunity fell in my lap. I met my future boss, mentor, and a dear friend through a chance encounter 2000 miles from home. During my interview, Jess told me she saw “C-level potential” in me. I didn’t understand what she meant, or what she saw in me that I did not see in myself. I guess she was right, a pattern that continues until today, because...\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/90d56f9131.jpg\" gallery=\"2014\" title=\"Jess Gartner's Move\" description=\"Jess sent me this photo when we were discussing me coming to work at Allovue.

I formally left behind a role defined by data analysis to one defined by product management. I am not sure I knew what product management meant. I’m still figuring that out. [^ted] That summer, we released our first product, Manage. The night before a major product demo and our \"announcing\" we were in the market with our first customer, everything was broken. I was shaking I was so nervous. At every moment, it felt like I was about to be more proud of what we had accomplished than of any other thing I have done in my whole career or like we were about to fail in some irrecoverable way and this ride would be over. We got it fixed, it worked, we made our first critical sales, and Jess was able to raise our Series A round that fall.\n\n[^ted]: Ted, our CTO who has since left Allovue, was a huge mentor to me those first three years.

Elsa's mom moved in with us and brought along with her our second dog, Brandy. Moving was hard. We had just completed redoing our kitchen and bathroom and everything at our condo was just how we liked it. Although Elsa decided to leave her job and was looking for work, the last two years we had started to feel established in our community in Providence. We had solid personal and professional supports. Providence became the home we built together, but it was time to go. In retrospect, I'm glad we left.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/76d567d028.jpg\" gallery=\"2016\" title=\"Camden Yards\" description=\"My whole life, my uncle, dad, and I talked about driving down to Baltimore to see a game at Camden Yards.

I turned 30, and I started to take working out more seriously because years of work travel and neglect made me feel bad. I wanted to get back some of the healthy habits I had built a few years prior when Elsa and I both lost a fair amount of weight. Allovue's CTO Ted left, and I was put in charge of development in addition to design, product management, and data integration. Although we weathered that initial transition well, I think it's only in 2019 that I truly began to feel comfortable with my new role. We also released our first version of our Budget tool, our second major software product. We bought our house in Hampden, Baltimore. For the first time, we have enough room for family and friends to visit and stay with us and we can host holidays. I love our new home and we're building a nice life here. Some of my heart remains in Providence, but Baltimore is nudging its way in. I still don't feel I've built the strong emotional ties to Baltimore I had for Providence, but I'd like to get there someday.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/85ec08e231.jpg\" gallery=\"2017\" title=\"Chilaquiles\" description=\"The best chilaquiles I've ever eaten.

I left two weeks later for a wonderful trip with Elsa and visited East Asia for the first time. When I came home, my grandmother had passed away. A month later, my Uncle Marty, who lived with me throughout my childhood, was gone as well. It was the worst two months of my life. The rest of this year is a blur.\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/9ed3e82542.jpg\" gallery=\"2018\" title=\"Gracie and Brandy on my Parent's Stoop\" description=\"Nothing like these faces when you walk up to a house.\" >}}\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/f72b4650eb.jpg\" gallery=\"2018\" title=\"Favorite Trees\" description=\"I have a lot of pictures of trees.

We acquired Equiday. We started to put a lot of work into scaling our people and processes and started to work on some still-secret projects that I believe will be the core of our next decade of success. Elsa and I took a wonderful trip to Spain. I failed to keep up with any meaningful physical health routine, but my mental health improved. 2019 is one of the best years I have had in a long time. I rose to meet some major challenges. I traveled more for fun than I have in years. I felt more secure in my friendships, and I felt more secure in my ability to do my job. It took a decade, but at the end of 2019, I'm feeling pretty good about the adult I am still becoming.\n\n<div class='img-gallery'>\n{{<glightbox src=\"https://json.blog/uploads/2021/b425c745f3.jpg\" gallery=\"2019\" title=\"Wyman Park\" description=\"I started this year with a long walk from my house to Charles Village, which takes me through Wyman Park.

Fully fund high cost SPED circuit breaker. Add a weight for high service percent per day SPED students, probably somewhere around 50% in service.\n5. Double pay about 5% on charters (districts hold back 5% of total per pupil, state kicks that in extra for charters). Require districts offer underutilized space to charters with something like right of first refusal to try and reduce overall systems capital costs. Districts should risk forfeiting 5% if fail to offer space to charters.\n6. Consider state wide minimum property/land tax to raise more money to go through the formula, reducing incentive/ability for high wealth districts to raise so much from local taxes the overall distribution of spending becomes highly regressive.\n",
