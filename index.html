        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Internet has generated one huge machine to press upon every self-doubt I have. Any small victory looks paltry when compared against the people I think are great, who are all the more greater as time goes on and it’s easier and easier to be exposed to the true Rockstars. We are all surrounded by the best of the best of the best at what they do, or at least, people who are very good at promoting that version of themselves.</p>

<p>Too few of us, myself included, will ever be that kind of rockstar. I am not going to be one of the top 100 or even top 10,000 people in the world at anything I try to do. There are too many people, too much brilliance to hope for that. I am old enough and exposed enough to know I don’t shine that bright. Honestly, I’m mostly fine with that, though I can imagine how much healthier my self image would be if my world was smaller, even as I would be so much poorer for not knowing what else there was.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s so powerful when someone else truly believes in you. I will not be a rockstar. I’m not a rockstar. I have little hope of being a rockstar. I see that completely and objectively. But having someone in your life who sees that in you, who believes that potential exists but for luck and opportunity, is still so powerful. On the surface, I might believe the are delusional or exaggerating. But in my heart, it makes me wish I could prove them right.</p>

<p>I am better, because I have other people who truly believe in me, people I treasure and respect. It makes me want to be who they see and pushes me farther than I could go on my own.</p>

         	<blockquote>
<p>Slave-owners were particularly afraid of allowing democratic control over property because they were literally afraid of their property. They were haunted by the threat of slave insurrections, as well as foreign armies turning their slaves into enemy soldiers through offers of freedom (as the British had recently done). Einhorn concludes that “if property rights have enjoyed unusual sanctity in the United States, it may be because this nation was founded in a political situation in which the owners of one very significant form of property thought their holdings were insecure.”</p>

<p>What Leno gets wrong is exactly the headline, &ldquo;In my heart, I knew it was wrong.”</p>

<p>This quote is more honest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At the time I did those jokes, I genuinely thought them to be harmless.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s real. What he thought was wrong, and he should have figured out that he was wrong sooner, and today he knows that.</p>

<p>Forgiveness requires contrition. And I do believe that Leno is contrite, but that&rsquo;s not for me to decide. We&rsquo;re doomed if we cannot find a way to forgive anyone for any transgression in society, but we (largely white men) also need to do a better job. We need to learn faster and better, by listening more often and more closely. Part of that is learning how to apologize.</p>

<p>Leno said things in the past that he thought were funny. He thought they did not create harm, directly or indirectly. He failed to listen to peoples&rsquo; pain, and he failed to consider their pain or impact adequately before making these statements to begin with. We all do this at times, especially when we&rsquo;re young, though hopefully not so much by the time we&rsquo;re adult professionals.</p>

<p>Own it. Be wrong. There was no “In my heart, I knew it was wrong.” You didn&rsquo;t feel anything in your heart at all about it. If you did, it would mean that your empathy was triggered and there&rsquo;s no way you would have made those jokes, or stood behind them when called out.</p>

<p>I have said terrible things I wish I could forget. But worse, I have said terrible things I have forgotten because in my heart, <em>they meant nothing to me</em>. I feel sadly certain that I will do so again.</p>

<p>I am sorry. I hope I learn better, faster. But when my heart knows anything at all, it prevents me from making those mistakes. That&rsquo;s its job.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>Prospect</em> has that look, the industrial, aged, space junk of our 1980s future. There’s only three days left before this system is going to be abandoned by civilization, but there’s riches to be found on the surface first. We begin with Damon and his teenage daughter, Cee. Damon is a drug user, a hustler, and broke. Their pod is broke. He’s pushing to do this one last job in the small amount of time they have left.</p>

<p>They land on a lush forest world, the Green, whose air is full of a particulate dust that makes for a beautiful reflective haze over all things. We learn that Damon can remove a gem from dangerous, living deposits found in the Green, and although they quickly find one worth plenty to change Cee and Damon’s fortunes, it’s not enough. They’re in the Green because Damon has been hired by mercenaries to dig up a cache that will make everyone rich.</p>

<p>In comes Ezra (Pedro Pascale) and Number 2, also diggers in the Green who stumble upon Damon and make clear that life in the Green is not just dangerous because of the elements. Without getting too deep into spoilers, the remainder of the movie is 2 parts Western, 1 part survivalist, including meeting settlers and the mercenaries.</p>

<p>This movie does all the things I love about smaller sci-fi. It lets its characters live and act in the world authentically, not explaining every step of the way but instead just showing us what crude space living is. The tension is there— can they get back on time, will they get back with their bounty, and what will it take out of them— but so is plenty of time to appreciate the beauty of this world. The contrast of our Earthly, almost fairy-like forrest with the gas giant that dominates an open vista above, we get the best of first contact/colonist/new world space exploration alongside the Ridley Scott-like set design for all things industrial, including extensive use of simple machines with clean lines, dirty nylons, small single-purpose screens, ruggedized parts, and a foreign glyph for writing.</p>

<p>What can I say? I love Westerns and I love this kind of low budget sci-fi about a dirty, industrial, hard space. <em>Prospect</em> was a movie that was made for me.</p>

        <a href="https://json.blog/2021/03/19/call-me-by.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-03-19 23:15:24 -0400">Mar 19, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It feels strange to watch <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> post the revelations about Armie Hammer. I know why this movie was so acclaimed. The cinematography is magnificent. The setting, idyllic. I spent much of my time while watching this movie fantasizing about a world where you summer in a gorgeous Italian countryside home within a fruit orchard, swimming, riding your bike into town, reading, and playing music, without, of course, the internet.</p>

<p>I was drawn to a few scenes in particular. In our opening, as Oliver (Hammer) pulls up to the villa, he’s exhausted from jet lag and travel and collapses into bed in the late afternoon only to emerge the following morning. I found myself wistful for international travel, knowing that loopy feeling of a long flight with little sleep, walking out into a time that feels all wrong, in a brand new place that feels as foreign as it is. There’s something special about that tired first 24 hours in a new country. It’s a feeling I’ve missed in this long pandemic year.</p>

<p>When Elio (Timothée Chalamet) reveals his feelings to Oliver around a World War I memorial, the camera work is perfect. Looking up and down just like an unsure teenager’s head would bob around as they fearfully reveal a deep truth. Elio and Oliver are set across from each other, far apart as confessions are made, with the camera following their circling of the monument, allowing the monument to obscure them both just as they are out of sight with each other.</p>

<p>Overall, this movie is just too long. It’s well-paced, but it’s beauty cannot overcome the fact that I don’t feel the fear, or the heartbreak, or even the elation of the young love. I saw it, but I didn’t feel it, and so <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> was beautiful, but flat.</p>

<p>I wish there were more movies like this one, but I didn’t like this one very much.</p>

         	<p>Look, testing this year is likely to be a disaster. The option to wait until the fall is an especially good one. But anyone who doubts there&rsquo;s value in <em>any</em> testing happening should look to everyone who says that schools will be &ldquo;overfunded&rdquo; with the latest round of ESSER/ARP money.</p>

<p>They will be &ldquo;overfunded&rdquo; only in the sense that they have an actual increase in money to spend. A generation of students whose schooling has been interrupted and/or disrupted are going to need extra supports to get back on track, and that is going to take extra resources. Without the achievement data that shows this, the (largely right wing) commentariat are out in force to say that schools have too much money that they will surely waste.</p>

<p>Forget about extra expenses related to COVID-19 that have already occurred. There are new needed supports that require resources to make sure a generation of students get the education they deserve. Frankly, we weren&rsquo;t doing that great on that measure before the pandemic.</p>

         	<p>News of the end of Indie.vc didn&rsquo;t really surprise me. I thought, &ldquo;Yes, this is a great example of trying to have all the advantages of the VC label and the Indie label and it&rsquo;s going to match no one’s pattern and may not even make sense.” But this week, with <a href="https://medium.com/[@bryce](https://micro.blog/bryce)/what-ended-indie-76575463934d">more of the results and challenges revealed</a>, I have swapped to the same disappointment others have expressed.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned working at a start up, it&rsquo;s that our capital markets are an irrational mess, and successful more by chance than strategy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I shared this frustration with a friend and LP, they replied “you’re playing a value hand in a growth game”. They were absolutely right. The way the startup game is played, even compelling fundamentals take a distant back seat to how much money companies are raising, at what valuation they are raising it, and which top-tier firm is leading the raise. This is not a knock; rather, an acknowledgment that those are the rules. I tried to play by a different set of rules and got burned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry&ndash; this is should be a knock. We&rsquo;d have a better, richer world [^richer] if we could get the capital markets to play a <em>value hand</em> rather than the illusory <em>growth hand</em> every single time. The <em>growth hand</em> only works for a small number of investors with a small number of companies focused narrowly on a particular type of problem and solution.</p>

<p>[^richer}:  By which I mean we&rsquo;d have better products, solving real problems, from people other than white Stanford dropouts.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>Cherry</em> was almost certainly a better book than a movie. It’s told in parts, including an epilogue, and it feels rushed in film. Do all the essential notes of a complex story of young love, war, poverty and PTSD, self-destruction, and reemergence get hit? Yes. But it ends up feeling like many movies I’ve seen before put together in one place, each executed well, but with the whole just coming up feeling a bit dull.</p>

<p>There’s nothing dull about Tom Holland or Ciara Bravo, who are electrifying together and apart. At the start of the movie, I felt like their love and the point of view of Cherry (Tom Holland) was too obsessed with the male gaze and a fucked up version of masculinity that I’m just over with. But I came to really enjoy their relationship, for all its toxicity, and was wrapped up in their life and their struggle. It was a bit hard for me to believe everything about them, adorable as it was, prior to Cherry going off to war, but once he returns, their relationship becomes the most real thing in the film.</p>

<p>I’m glad to see Tom Holland in a different light, but I already liked him. Ciara Bravo is new to me, and I hope I will see her for a long time. She seamlessly transitioned from an adept, if tired, manic pixie dream girl to trying to be supportive wife to full on heroin addict. Each transition is only one scene, and if it weren’t executed with her considerable skill, it would have broken the film.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>We sure do have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/america-growing-disparities/">a lot of crumbling infrastructure in the US</a>. But I can&rsquo;t help but to think a lot of the infrastructure gap comes from past policies subsidizing unsustainable development of rural areas and the suburbs. Imagine if instead of building highways to empty land to develop single-family suburban detached homes, we built trains to new village centers that were mixed use, mixed income, and mixed form housing.</p>

<p>America fetishizes community, until that community because pluralist and mixed-race. Then we began to fetishize individualism instead, just in time to lock up centuries of advantage. We glorify the frontier. We exalt the family homestead. We command dominion over all lands. And so, America has large suburban pastures stretched well beyond the municipal limits with sewers, roads, bridges, power lines, copper, and fiber. We borrowed long term debt for systems that would last decades and road population growth driven by immigration (but not those immigrants, and no longer) and cheap energy that borrowed from the future&rsquo;s climate to pay down these huge initial investments. Through government subsidies and programs, we created a new homeowner class, handing wealth to whites in the form of a tangible asset. Those assets depreciate, but slowly, so slowly that it would take more than a lifetime to notice.</p>

<p>Once established in our new homes and new suburbs and new cars, segregated and building familial wealth, it was easy to ignore the maintenance. New stuff rarely breaks. America builds best. It&rsquo;s easy enough to fix things once they need to be fixed. Maintenance investment is not sexy. On the other side of those projects, things work as expected. There&rsquo;s nothing new to show off. No accomplishments to put your name on. Our predecessors built this, what have I got to show for my time? And so, we ignore the slow rot that stretches across our infrastructure. We built unsustainably, and every social, political, and cultural incentive line up to add more, even less sustainable infrastructure.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that America built itself up during the Cold War. Communism, our mortal enemy, sought to plan. America&rsquo;s muscular capitalism would never make that mistake.</p>

<p>And then came the greed. The America of the 80s inherited the investments of the first half of the 20th century and everything &ldquo;worked&rdquo; splendidly, if you were the kind of person who had resources already. Government spending and investment was not seen as the supporting platform on top of which our wealth was generated, but instead was stealing from the deserving winners in our so-called meritocracy. The spiral of disinvestment was solidified right as the ratio of benefits to current costs on our infrastructure hit its peak.</p>

<p>It is no wonder why so many parts of America crumbles, forgotten. Rot is everywhere, often unseen. It&rsquo;s fueled by white flight. It&rsquo;s fueled by individualism. It&rsquo;s fueled by neo-frontierism, and Manifest Destiny. It&rsquo;s fueled by power and privilege.</p>

<p>The solutions will take decades, if not centuries. Some places do not work in America. Truthfully, they never have, not in any long term way. More and more cities and towns will die, as they often have throughout history on the far reaches of human occupation. Illusory wealth created will fade, and individuals and their families will be hurt by no fault of their own. We will have to build new forms, make a different set of investments that slowly reshapes our country. We will have to do so with an eye toward sustainability, for the planet and for future inhabitants of our communities.</p>

<p>Or we won&rsquo;t, and the problems will continue, and we will decline, fighting instead to slow the fall and avoid collapse, giving up on a great future because it requires change.</p>

         	<p>If you’re using the Bigfoot plug-in on Micro.blog, I recommend reinstalling. I added two options last night.</p>

<p>First, you can now choose if your footnotes are numbered or just get &hellip;.</p>

<p>Second, I added the ability to specify what CSS selector your posts are separated by. This allows you to have numbering reset by post on index pages and anywhere multiple posts are seen. Before, if you had two posts with footnotes on the front page, your second post might start with footnote 5 (if the first post had four footnotes).</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>An undeniable cast. The best use of fan service and callbacks of just about any “late sequel” I’ve seen. Does <em>Coming 2 America</em> capture the magic of the original? This is no classic. But did I enjoy it all throughout? Yes.</p>

<p>Each time the movie felt like it dragged a bit, it provided a moment that rewarded those of us who have seen the original a hundred times.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest flaw in <em>Coming 2 America</em> is it focus on Lavelle Junson (Jermain Fowler) over the more interesting daughters of Akeem (Eddie Murphy). Princess Meeka (KiKi Layne) was a far richer and more interesting character than her half-brother; so was Mirembe (Nomzamo Mbatha). And in spite of the inspired casting of Leslie Jones as Mary Junson, the talented women who stole every one of their scenes are under utilized.</p>

<p>Nearly all notable members of the original cast returns, which I found more delightful than tired. A quiet scene in McDowell’s of Zumunda with Cleo (John Amos) is one of the film’s best, and a surprise cameo by  Fresh Peaches and Sugar Cube (the beat boxing twins from the club in the original’s dating montage) is a highlight.</p>

<p>Will I watch this again? Probably not. But was I glad to spend a Friday night with these characters? Absolutely.</p>

<li>How little all the areas I have chosen to engage in any form of activism have changed in the last 15 years.</li>

<p>I now am forced to wonder if we’ll make any progress on the problems I care about, or if instead, my only real hope is new problems eclipse them in importance.</p>

<p>It’s not like nothing gets better by any stretch, but there’s so much stagnation. So many battles are fought on an inter-generational timescale.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see how more committed activists burn out, and even easier to see why some despair so hugely at a single loss. Sometimes losing a single battle ends any hope that they will live to see the change they fight for in this world.</p>

        <a href="https://json.blog/2021/02/11/a-frustrating-conversation.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-02-11 14:35:09 -0400">Feb 11, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A good friend of mine for decades has long identified as conservative. In a recent conversation, we discussed his support for single-payer health insurance, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (in part to get national ID laws that are fair and free), and more.</p>

<p>When they expressed their support for lower taxes and limited government, I asked “what does lower mean?”</p>

<p>He answered, &ldquo;as low as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, “As low as possible to support what the government needs to be run successfully, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ok, so then when you say limited government, you mean limited to what? What&rsquo;s something the government does today that you don&rsquo;t think it should be doing?”</p>

<p>They admitted, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question.&rdquo; They had no specific examples, and when we dug into a couple of ideas (transit was one), it was relatively easy to convince him that it&rsquo;s very possible the government should be doing this work.</p>

<p>In the end, their conservatism largely came down to a statement I let go by, unready and unwilling to engage with it at the moment. They off-handedly said, &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll never be a democrat, because I don&rsquo;t believe an 8 year old should be able to declare their gender.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t ready to address the casual transphobia that I know was informed by beliefs they were taught in their church. The conversation was primarily focused on the mess that is the current GOP around voting.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s bothered me for days since that I didn&rsquo;t confront them about their casual transphobia. In fact, the whole conversation was about how liberals shut down conservatives by having clear moral lines when, in fact, they could and should convince more conservatives that their policies are good. And within that context, it felt like a really tough thing to dig into their beliefs on social issues.</p>

<p>Yet, causal transphobia being left unchallenged will spread.</p>

<p>What I wish I had said, even if it was just briefly at the end was this. “Before you dismiss the experience of trans people entirely, I think you should have a conversation with someone who is trans. Learn about their experiences. I wonder if after that, you could find it in your heart to have a lot more kindness and compassion to accept them as people.”</p>

         	<p><em>Chef</em> is a movie for anyone who loves food and loves cooking. No surprises there. But if you like watching competent people in the kitchen make food that looks incredible, I’m not sure any other movie competes.</p>

<p>The cast is fantastic. Favreau and Leguizamo are great, but every role, big or small received the same careful attention. Oliver Platt, Amy Sedaris, and Bobby Cannavale are stand outs.</p>

<p>Despite the call outs to Vine, the idea that Twitter is novel and hard to understand, or the skepticism of food trucks that firmly place <em>Chef</em> in its time, the movie hardly feels dated. It’s a classic story— middle-aged man who has lost his way and neglected his family rediscovering himself and rebuilding his relationship with his son along the way.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing— if you make a movie that has beautiful cooking and shows off Cubanos, beignets, and brisket from Franklin’s? I’m going to show up. And in this year, when I haven’t been able to travel to these places that I went every year to eat the food that makes those places special&hellip; damn that hits.</p>

         	<p>A <a href="https://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2021/01/22/getting-school-finance-indicators-right/">good overview</a> on important work in school finance. The flat-to-regressive financing of schools nationwide represents a failure of state finance systems to overcome the inequities introduced by having local-based funding and control of schools.</p>

<p>The core purpose of state funding (and federal funding) is to take advantage of better funded, larger jurisdictions to do redistributive policy that counteracts the unequal opportunity caused by local funding. Our national failure to drive enough dollars through states through sufficiently progressive mechanisms results in a failure to equalize opportunity.</p>

<p>This is the real reason why zip codes define the destiny of children. It is not about district effectiveness or efficiency, but instead about district starvation of resources to meet the challenges they face, while others are awash in the money they need.</p>

<p>When we say we favor local control of education, we are advocating for maintaining a tiered system of access to resources and school quality. We are saying the rent or mortgage parents can afford and/or the distance they can travel for work defines the opportunity for their children.</p>

<p>Layering on our history of housing segregation and the drawing of school district and municipal boundaries to explicitly create white and not white, have and have not schools and communities, school finance fairness serves as a quantified keyhole through which we observe a state-supported caste system in the US.</p>

This will also be the longest I&rsquo;ve gone without a new Mac <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:newage"><a href="#fn:newage">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Taking stock of software is going to be hard, but my first step to prepare for this new computer is actually related to I/O. I currently have a 2016 retina MacBook Pro with Four Thunderbolt ports. Every port, including the headphone port, is in use. The new Mac mini has only two Thunderbolt ports, but also comes with some additional ports.</p>

<p>On the left side, I have an Ethernet to Thunderbolt adapter, my microphone (Audio-Technica ATR2100 mini USB-A to USB-C), and a 3.5mm to RCA cable that goes into my powered speakers (Kanto YU-5s). On the right side, I have a Thunderbolt cable that goes into the LG 5K Ultrafine monitor, providing power, display, and acting as a USB-C hub, and a USB-C cable going to a Samsung SSD I mount under my desk which is my primary Time Machine drive.</p>

<p>I am also using all of the ports on the back of my display. There, I have the connection to my laptop, a USB-C cable to a 4-port USB-A hub (where I keep my Logitech mouse universal reciever thing plugged in and otherwise just have it available for hot swaps), a USB-C to USB-A micro cable (which I use to plug in a Blu-ray drive or my Fujitsu Scansnap scanner when needed, but often is just &ldquo;danging&rdquo;, and my keyboard.</p>

<p>I truly went all in on the USB-C lifestyle, primarily though the use of new cables.</p>

<p>The Mac mini, however, has one ethernet port, one headphone jack, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and two USB-A ports.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I think I&rsquo;ll re-arrange my cables. The monitor and SSD will remain directly plugged in via Thunderbolt 4/USB-C. The ethernet adapter can go away for direct use of the ethernet port. The microphone will move to being plugged into the monitor by using the slot vacated by my keyboard which I will plug directly into one of the USB-A ports on the Mac mini. I will also move the mouse to being directly plugged in via USB-A rather than using the four port USB-A adapter. At that point, I think I could actually remove the USB-A hub entirely&ndash; I use it very rarely, I already have one USB-A micro cable dangling and ready, and I&rsquo;d have an additional USB-C port freed up behind my monitor. I keep several USB-something to USB-C cables on a pegboard above my desk and have 3 USB-A to C adapters there as well (of which I only really need to keep one).</p>

<p>Was I originally nervous about moving from four, versatile, fast Thunderbolt ports to two? Absolutely. But once I went through how I actually use all cables attached to my computer, I quickly realized that I would be in great shape. One thing this setup will not allow for is easy hot swapping back to my laptop at my desk. If I had kept the keyboard and mouse attached to the monitor, then I could move one cable and reasonably be back at work on my other computer. I decided that this is a non-goal. In truth, it&rsquo;ll probably just delay me from doing a good job of fully migrating from my laptop to my new desktop.</p>

<li id="fn:newage">I truly think we&rsquo;re in a new age where Macs are finally exciting and worth buying again. I frequently traded in my Mac after 2-3 years before because there was a reason to. I didn&rsquo;t keep this Mac for five years because I wanted to, I kept it because I had no reason to upgrade. I think this is equal parts the longevity of my 2016 rMBP, which I wisely upgraded to 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD and better processor and the lack of new compelling products. No more.

         	<p>For a while, I visited home roughly every 8-10 weeks after I moved away. My uncle would invariably have some article that was in the paper just that week he wanted to share with me when I got there.</p>

<p>I never thought about how this was a way to make sure we stopped to have a conversation. He worked strange hours, often overnight, and so overlapping wasn&rsquo;t always easy.</p>

<p><a href="https://json.blog/2018/05/28/uncle.html">I still miss him</a>.</p>

<p>He and I would have had a lot discuss these last few weeks, with the Georgia runoff, insurrection at the Capitol, and now swearing in of President Biden and Vice President Harris.</p>

<p>This last year would have infuriated him and saddened him, and my grandmother. I can hear the way they would have sounded as they cheered during the swearing in. I know they would have called me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s strange the times we remember those we have loved and now lost. But although I am sad thinking of them, I like to sit in these melancholy moments, because they are the times that my memories are most vivid and complete.</p>

         	<p>Two great leads, too smart, too quick, waxing philosophic in the nadir of their relationship as they are stuck cohabitating until the end of London’s first lockdown. Is <em>Locked Down</em> about the haphazard heist in its third act? No, of course not. It’s almost a silly bit of Harrod’s advertisement tacked on to a timely one-location film about discovery and romance during pandemic times.</p>

<p>Zoom and Skype have quickly become a part of television and film produced in the last year, and <em>Locked Down</em> uses these devices well, with strong appearances by Dulé Hill, Sir Ben Kingsley, Ben Stiller, and Mindy Kaling. I do wonder if all these stories produced now, about now will have staying power.</p>

<p>But Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathway are both magnificent as a couple whose relationship has died with much left to say to each other and learn about themselves.</p>

<p>For some people, <em>Locked Down</em> will read as overly dramatic, with dialog that is overly sophisticated and clunky even as it’s rendered with ease by two phenomenal actors. For others, it will read as literary or theatrical and quotable. For me, it’s too well acted, well made, and well paced to fall entirely flat, although I find myself wishing it had the conviction to have a far smaller third act. Having a daring, wild project where our leads work together ensure their rekindling and reconciliation feels great. Having that be an almost ridiculous set of circumstances leading to a diamond heist was maybe not the right wild project for my tastes.</p>

        <a href="https://json.blog/2021/01/10/the-midnight-sky.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-01-10 22:21:29 -0400">Jan 10, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Midnight Sky is about the end of the world. It’s about a man who is dying. It is about saving the last of humanity, at least for one more generation.</p>

<p>There are two stories taking places in this film, both in the harshest environments. We follow Augustine (George Clooney) in the North Pole and Sully (Felicity Jones) and the crew of the <em>Aether</em> on return from a fictional moon of Jupiter that can support human life on its surface. I was surprised at how much time <em>The Midnight Sky</em> spent in space— I thought I was watching a movie about George Clooney versus the elements, his terminal illness, and his loneliness. But this movie was also about the crew of the Aether, their battle against the elements and their loneliness (and uncertainty, with all contact from Earth suddenly ceasing). They serve as coequal story arcs, with an unsurprising connection.</p>

<p>I think <em>The Midnight Sky</em> is weakest when it resorts to trite story elements, like an early sequence where Sully is terrified by events that turn out to be a dream. There are flashbacks to Augustine’s early career (mercifully casting a different actor for the role rather than using de-aging effects) that feel unnecessary.</p>

<p>But although this movie moves through well-trodden ground, it does so adeptly and beautifully. Pacing, acting, and visual effects are superb. What it lacks is that extra bit of emotional resonance that would have made it feel marvelous, even if it used some old tricks.</p>

         	<p>This is why I will endlessly critique what I view as entirely too mild and too muddied critiques of Trumpism from like 3 members of the Republican delegation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question you should ask is who the right kind of person would be to make a particular criticism for a particular audience, at that particular time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— Adam Gurri, <a href="https://www.liberalcurrents.com/how-to-avoid-creating-the-next-trump/">Stop Putting Money in Andy Ngo’s Pocket</a></p>

<p>These are the people to be making clear the total unacceptability of Trumpism. They are the ones that need to draw the clear line, and show how the current GOP movement crosses over to fascism. Romney has come closest to fulfilling that role. Hell, even Paul Ryan came out of nowhere and did a slightly better job. But for the most part, the people I know who are center-right are not doing a good job. Many of them will say the right thing, but they&rsquo;ll also overly shower praise on tepid statements from moderates that fall far short of the repudiation that&rsquo;s required. They won&rsquo;t hold their own best standard bearers to account for not going far enough.</p>

<p>It means next to nothing for me to say words like fascism and sedition. Anyone who is listening to me, anyone who trusts me, they know we crossed a line a long time ago. The weakness of institutional republicans is a key element to Trump&rsquo;s ascendency and maintenance of power and influence. And the truth is, that weakness comes from being built on a rotten foundation. Without any kind of old institutional power, the GOP is no longer grand, nor old, but instead, a new party taken over from within. The GOP is dead, long live the GOP.</p>

<p>The center right needs to accept this reality, defect, and build actual standard bearers with a real chance of challenging Trumpism and the left (if, in fact, their beliefs are still counter to the American left).</p>

        <a href="https://json.blog/2021/01/04/the-vast-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-01-04 21:46:59 -0400">Jan 4, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In <em>The Vast of Night</em>, 16-year old evening telephone operator Fay Crocker and radio DJ Everett Sloan stumble across a strange sound in the telephone lines and radio airways. What is this whirring sound, almost like a windmill, but less natural, with a distinct atonal voice coming through.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vafDhDla48c">featurette showing an impressive long tracking shot</a> that last about 4 minutes in The Vast of Night. It is impressive and well-conceived. But the best trick in The Vast of Night comes in the scene directly following this shot. Everett patches the sound Fay heard through to the radio and asks, “Has anyone ever heard such a thing?“ That’s when caller Billy is introduced. As Billy tells his story of strange events during his service in the air force, the screen goes black for long stretches of time. Billy is a voice on the radio, and we get to experience him entirely as a voice on the radio. There’s no cut to Billy. Nothing visual establishes him. His story is told to us as the characters in the film experiences it, with an occasional flash of our protagonists reacting in to something important that he says. We listen, and the movie deftly gives us cues on how to react by showing us Everett and Fay just every so often.</p>

<p>From there, the chase is on, first to another town denizen with stories of people in the sky and finally to look at what it is that’s in the sky, as reported by those few people who are not at the high school basketball game.</p>

<p>At times, <em>The Vast of Night</em> is a bit too cute. We open to a Twilight Zone-like TV show on an old tube set that’s meant to tell us we are watching a similar television program. There are several shots throughout that swap the dark, grainy almost Instagram-like tones of the majority of the movie to a faded, cyan-heavy, tube-TV look to remind us, “This is all a show.” It’s not just visually unappealing, but it served to take me out of the film and lower the stakes. We’re in early 50s, small town rural America at night where the streets are dark with a masterful soundtrack and rich diegetic sound that raise the stakes and intensity. It’s dark, there’s naturalistic dialog with mumbling and extreme crosstalk. And then we’re forced to become all too aware of the hand of the director, ripping us to a television screen, as if to say, “Don’t be scared. Don’t feel anxious. This is just a story.”</p>

<p><em>The Vast of Night</em> joins a rich tradition of smaller, less expensive films that uses its budget well to tell a science fiction story that feels real and personal. But the filmmakers need to communicate that this modern film was just a piece of 50s pulp television ultimately undermines its successful world building instead of enhancing it. If they only had the conviction to let the audience live in Cayuga, New Mexico&hellip;</p>

			<h1><a href="https://json.blog/2021/01/03/greenland.html">🍿 Greenland (2020) ★★★★</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://json.blog/2021/01/03/greenland.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-01-03 23:37:32 -0400">Jan 3, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>This review contains spoilers.</em></p>

<p>Movies like Greenland have certain beats they have to hit.</p>

<p>Start with a normal life that is revealed to already be imperfect or broken in some way, usually between two lovers. Underestimate a coming threat. Rapid realization that things are about to get dangerous fast, showing lots of fear and uncertainty. Take action to survive. Show the world falling a part and have otherwise &ldquo;normal&rdquo; seeming people act in ways that under normal circumstances are completely immoral. Let the audience question what happens to morality under these new conditions. Race to survival through trial and tribulation. Sometimes you live, sometimes you die, but you always resolve that initial conflict shown from the Before Times.</p>

<p>Did I just describe Greenland? Yes, and plenty of other films/stories like it. But just because there is a formula, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the formula is bad. Greenland executes this race to survival very well. I felt the rush of adrenaline and anxiety throughout this movie. I felt genuine fear. I felt genuinely uncertain if they would make it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s real horror when a message flashes on the television at a birthday party that makes it clear that only one family in this suburban neighborhood was being chosen to evacuate. I was already anxious as Gerard Butler didn&rsquo;t immediately and quietly throw his family in the car when he got home from the grocery store where he received his first warning. And I felt the crushing claustrophobia of the crowds at the military air base trying to squeeze in to be allowed on the planes leaving for Greenland. I was nearly crushed by the child abduction and felt genuine relief when our main family is united at grandpa&rsquo;s farm house.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything that detracts from this movie, I think it&rsquo;s the happy ending. I&rsquo;m not sure there was any need for the shots of destruction around the Earth. I don&rsquo;t think there was a need for showing the bunker doors opening and the return of wildlife. In fact, I think the movie plays fast and loose with the audience only once, and that&rsquo;s when it shows the &ldquo;flashes&rdquo;, telegraphed repeatedly as what you see before dying, prior to the films unnecessary coda. This should have been a signal they did not survive. There&rsquo;s no reason not to end the movie there. I don&rsquo;t think Greenland is ruined by its happy ending, but I think just a few choices in how it&rsquo;s presented were just a bit inelegant compared to the rest of the film. I also didn&rsquo;t like how a character literally has to say, &ldquo;You were chosen because you&rsquo;re a structural engineer who builds buildings.&rdquo; This should have been clear to the audience and characters without being spelled out.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a story that&rsquo;s been told, but it&rsquo;s told competently with great acting performances and some stunning visuals that are well deployed. The ending is a little bit creaky compared to an otherwise extremely competent execution.</p>

        <a href="https://json.blog/2020/11/16/the-shape-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-11-16 17:34:32 -0400">Nov 16, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I think there are three groups that should be addressed at once by any policy looking to provide relief to student debt holders.</p>

<ol>
<li>Current student debt holders</li>
<li>Future college attendees</li>
<li>Non-college attendees</li>
</ol>

<p>These three groups are more relevant than income brackets for understanding the moral basis for debt relief. Student debt relief is not about strict income redistribution, but instead about:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rationalizing the debt load that college attendees have taken on in the last twenty years with the costs to past generations.</strong> Recent college attendees pay significantly higher costs and have had two (or maybe 3 if you squeak in the tech bubble) major recessions that they have faced. The Warren plan of forgiving the first $50,000 of student loan debt works nicely here as a way to make the debt load of recent students better resemble the debt loads of previous generations of college graduates.</li>
<li><strong>We have to also tackle the costs of college going forward, because they are still too high, and debt relief does nothing to avoid recreating this problem.</strong> Here, we can imagine a number of policies that the federal government could pursue to curtail rising costs. I would love to see some combination of restricting federal financial aid and student loans to certain top-level caps and remove institutions from being eligible for federal support that raise costs too much year over year with an increase in Pell Grants. We need both more grants for low income college attendees and a reduction in the federal governments role in ensuring the higher education market can easily increase their sticker price.</li>
<li><strong>Federally guaranteed sick and paid family leave is long overdue, and will materially change the condition for non-college graduates most of all.</strong> College graduates are far more likely to have jobs that provide some form of paid sick and family leave as a private benefit, but these benefits should be universal. And although student debt relief is not about strict income redistribution, there&rsquo;s no strong moral reason why we should provide large assistance to past college attendees without providing something to the many Americans struggling who don&rsquo;t and haven&rsquo;t attended college. Pursuing a parallel policy that will most impact non-college graduates helps to demonstrate that these policies are meant to provide relief to <em>all Americans</em>. <strong>An alternative policy that would also pair well here is a raise in the federal minimum wage and no longer excluding restaurant waitstaff from the minimum wage.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d pursue tackling debt relief as solid stimulus during COVID, while bending the cost curve on higher education and not leaving behind many Americans who don&rsquo;t end up in higher education.</p>

<ol>
<li>Suppressing the vote of the opposition.</li>
<li>Threatening and inciting violent militias to rise up against the opposition.</li>
<li>Increasing protectionism and economic isolation through tariffs while subsidizing domestic industry (largerly farmers) for their losses.</li>
<li>Pushes for a white, Christian, cis, hetero monoculture.</li>
<li>Worships their current leader, believing he cannot do any wrong.</li>
<li>Worships the cops as always acting in the best interest of True Citizens and the cornerstone of our society.</li>
<li>Actively gerrymanders (as do dems, but less completely) to ensure minority party rule, and goes even further so as to strip power from statewide offices during lame duck sessions when the opposition wins.</li>
<li>Believes in violence as a core method to secure their ends, using it to project power at home and abroad.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now read the introduction to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">Fascism article on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Can anyone honestly say that Trumpism is not fascism?</p>

<p>Our only hope to escape this fate is for democrats to decisively take the White House and the Senate and for their to be a peaceful transition in power, Hopefully, the win will be so decisive that the GOP will abandon Trumpism. But if we cannot achieve that, then the narrow Democrat victory must enact a series of structural forms to end minoritarianism.</p>

<p>If the Democrats lose, then I’m afraid we’ve lost the country and the damage will become irrevocable and accelerate.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am terrible at comforting people. I just want to do something. I want to solve the problem. I want to say the magic words that fix things. I want my love and my care to make it all go away.</p>

<p>Of course, when I am in a bad mood, there’s nothing the people around me can do to soothe me. There’s nothing to fix. Nothing to say. Often I have to let it &hellip; fizzle out of me. I will just, run out of energy to feel quite so foul and return to some kind of mean. Sometimes I need to read a book or watch a movie or show that will get me crying. Mostly, I probably just need to eat or drink a Diet Coke, because I’m a cranky fuck when I’m hungry or under-caffeinated.</p>

<p>But it has almost never been the case that someone can say or do something for me that fixes it. I have to deal with it, and even dealing with it often just involves enduring the lows until they fade.</p>

<p>And yet, I still so desperately want my own care to burn through and evaporate the dark clouds of those I love. So much so that I find myself speaking when I should be quiet. Offering council when I need to offer an ear. Trying so hard to be the who or what they need, even though I know I’m nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>People are not problems to be solved, but that’s the only hammer in my tool belt.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Amy Coney Barrett doesn’t deserve your defense because of her religion any more than she deserves criticism for it.</p>

<p>Of course, the actual critique is not her religious belief, but her belief that she has a duty to use her position in the courts to impose those beliefs on others.</p>

<p>The conservative movement talks a lot about patriotism. Their vision of patriotism is celebrating the history of a country whose past reflects their current values. This is not an active patriotism of taking part in the American project today and weaving ourselves in her fabric.</p>

<p>A higher form of patriotism actively participates in the American, small-l, liberal democratic tradition. In this patriotism, pride in America is connected to how she welcomed those of us with nowhere else to go. Her ongoing project and triumphs come from her struggle to build a functioning civil society out of radical pluralism. Patriotism in America is using the civic process to accept and incorporate people of all backgrounds into her body-politic.</p>

<p>I am Jewish, and until recently, I have found safety in America. That safety has been challenged many times in the past, and has, at times been compromised. Patriots view this with shame. Patriots view slavery with shame. They view Jim Crow with shame. They view the backlash against the Civil Rights movement, past and current tense, with shame. They view the treatment of Chinese immigrants throughout the 19th and early 20th century with shame. They view the treatment of Catholics in public schools with shame, and the questions of JFK&rsquo;s loyalty to the nation with shame.</p>

<p>Patriotic America celebrates radical pluralism. Every moment we celebrate in American political religion is about expansion of our ideals, welcoming new people and new thoughts into our project. Every moment we view with shame is about rejection.</p>

<p>It is in the context that the pre-accusations that Democrats or &ldquo;The Left&rdquo; are and will attack Amy Coney Barrett on her religion bring to mind the words of the Bard&ndash; <em>she doth protest too much</em>.</p>

<p>In a now off-cited <a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/527/">law review article</a> written when Barrett was 22, she herself posits that a Catholic judge may not be able to sit impartially over a death penalty case. The article is detailed, strong scholarship, if boring to someone disinterested in the finer points of the teachings of the Catholic Church. While it repeatedly states that trying to bring Catholic dogma and the law into alignment is neither possibly nor advisable for a judge, it makes clear there are moments a Catholic judge must use their discretion to act in accordance with their faith. Fair enough&ndash; exercising discretion in ways that align to personal moral beliefs is part of the role of being a judge, wherever those beliefs stem from.</p>

<p>Barrett is clear&ndash; her particular beliefs, grounded in her particular sect of Catholicism, will impact her jurisprudence, just like every judges. With her paltry three-year long history as a judge, we know she is being chosen, in fact, to sit on the highest court for possibly the next 40 years based not on her history as a jurist, but instead based on her belief. You cannot separate the reason the conservative right is excited for a Justice Barrett from her religion. Her legal scholarship is infused with her religion, and her record on her religious beliefs is thicker than her record as a judge.</p>

<p>So yes, her personal Catholicism and what we know about it is going to be deeply entwined with any rigorous discussion of where her jurisprudence will steer the country. That&rsquo;s not an attack on Catholicism, her religion does not disqualify her, that her religion impacts her morality and legal scholarship does not disqualify her.</p>

<p>Amy Coney Barrett holds views I find personally abhorrent. So do other members of the court, Catholic or not, and so do many members of the GOP and the conservative movement. I oppose them for those beliefs. I oppose them because I believe that they will lead to the material deprivation of the people I share this country with. I oppose them because I believe they will lead us away from America&rsquo;s moments of radical pluralism. I oppose them because I believe they are wrong for me as an individual and wrong for this country. I oppose them because the Christian Conservative movement oppresses, no matter how much they claim oppression for themselves.</p>

<p>If you think this means I am anti-Catholic, it is probably because you believe that I cannot consider a narrow set of your beliefs as abhorrent while practicing radical acceptance for you in the society we share. This is not true. I can love you in spite of your beliefs. I can protect your right to those beliefs. I can love you in the beliefs that we share and welcome all of you with radical pluralism. The ends of my acceptance lie when your personal power and exercise of those beliefs endanger the &ldquo;institutions of liberty&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:citation-needed"><a href="#fn:citation-needed">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A Justice Barrett on this court certainly qualifies.</p>

And yes, taken from Wikipedia, because I knew Rawls wrote about the paradox of tolerance in a way that resonated with me and that was where Google took me. The phrasing of putting &ldquo;institutions of liberty in danger&rdquo; was too precisely what I wanted to say for me to not site it and admit provenance. In general, if you want to know what I think of the world, it&rsquo;s a pretty good bet that you can start with Rawls and walk a long distance before finding disagreement on the finer points.

<p>The one liberal value blands tend to elide is inequality, because while blands are, by definition, not opulent, neither are they bargain-basement. For the rich, blands are an ironic normcore trifle; for the aspiring middle, blands offer a fleeting facsimile of prosperity; and for the poor, blands are either the products they make, or the services they provide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— Ben Schott, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-09-07/welcome-to-your-bland-new-world-of-consumer-capitalism">Welcome to Your Bland New World</a></p>

<p>I both loathe and love Blands myself. I am the target market, of course, but often find them disappointing relative to the standard bearers.</p>

<p>What I find attractive about most direct to consumer companies is not discussed too much in this article, which rightly criticizes their faux ethics and VC-backed rise and fall. No, what I like about most blands is an uncomplicated, consistent buying experience. Blands and their marketing buzz means I can get access to sufficient reviews and testimonials to know if the product is good. I can rely on an easy online shopping experience. Shipping is consistent and tracked. Return policies are reasonable.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that none of this was a given on the web, and therefore your choices were in person shopping or Amazon. Or at least it seemed that way to me.</p>

<p>In that sense, the really disruption to Blands has not been their proliferation beyond what the market can bear, nor has it been the Instagram dropshipping clones. The real change has been Shopify, and to a lesser degree Stripe and Square, which have made it easier for small businesses to have the same solid online shopping experience that Blands had.</p>

<p>Increasingly when I buy online, I recognize the same store design, the same email confirmation, and the same shipping tracking. Thi s is not bland— my experience in stores is consistent when buying in brick-and-mortar stores, and this consistency online is welcome. It increases my personal trust. It’s enabling small businesses with quality products to have presence.</p>

<p>Most of the Blands don’t have much to offer me anymore. They can’t differentiate amongst themselves, and they can’t compete with quality products from companies who sell great products for a profit instead of blitzscaling.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em><strong>Worth It</strong> is an occasional series on this blog where I post a bunch of links to things I&rsquo;ve read recently.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29749948/the-reality-black-pain-breaking-american-sports-status-quo">The reality of Black pain is breaking American sports&rsquo; status quo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most powerful corporations in this country have said these routine encounters have become unacceptable, thus it is not an embarrassment for the leagues that the players chose not to play, but wholly appropriate, an exacting of the promise. The message players sent was not that point guards are now moonlighting as legislators, but literally, their humanity must come first &ndash; that these Black lives literally matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kaepernick was right then, he&rsquo;s right now, and the conservative, white backlash will be judged poorly by history. It&rsquo;s thrilling to see athletes use their power.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen">They Know How to Prevent Megafires. Why Won’t Anybody Listen?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California’s agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The state passed a few new laws in 2018 designed to facilitate more intentional burning. But few are optimistic this, alone, will lead to significant change. We live with a deathly backlog. In February 2020, Nature Sustainability published this terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres — an area about the size of Maine — to restabilize in terms of fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me not to see a failure to empower experts in favor of proliferating small democracy everywhere as one of the main things that ills American society. Easy for me to say as a white, well-educated technocrat myself. But over and over again, in transit, in health, in education, and land management it seems, we seem to face insurmountable problems creating by decades of failure to value and empower expertise. It&rsquo;s a dangerous game&ndash; just look at the racist impacts of &ldquo;urban renewal&rdquo; in the recent past to find ample examples of why we should be cautious of experts. But the unfortunate combination of racism and ideal about individual freedoms have commingled into  what at times feels like an insurmountable barrier against positivist action for good.</p>

<p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/one-billion-americans-by-matthew-yglesias-book-excerpt.html">The Case for Adding 672 Million More Americans</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you tripled the population of the United States, adding the new Americans only to the Lower 48 and leaving Alaska and Hawaii intact and unchanged, the main part of America would be only about as dense as France and less than half as dense as Germany.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I probably won&rsquo;t read One Billion Americans, but that&rsquo;s mostly because I find it hard to imagine I&rsquo;ll disagree with any of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/movies/jesse-plemons.html">What Does Everyone See in Jesse Plemons?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plemons can toggle easily between eggheads and dimwits, good guys and bad guys, and it’s almost impossible to describe what he’s doing differently because he doesn’t appear to be doing anything at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fascinating profile of a recent <em>that guy</em> in Hollywood.</p>

<p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/514813-georgia-accused-of-wrongfully-purging-nearly-200000-from-voter-rolls">Georgia accused of wrongfully purging nearly 200,000 from voter rolls: report</a>:</p>

<p>Anyone paying attention knows how evil the Georgia&rsquo;s Secretary of State office has been in recent years. Just another reason to be terrified of the fragility of our system.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/">Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers’</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But according to sources with knowledge of this visit, Trump, while standing by Robert Kelly’s grave, turned directly to his father and said, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, everyone has read or has read a hot take about this story. Here&rsquo;s the essence though&ndash; Trump cannot fathom the existence of sacrifice or altruism. Individuals can only act in self-interest, and any hint otherwise is not just suspect, but a sign of being a &ldquo;loser&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sucker&rdquo;. Our country is in the hands of someone who doesn&rsquo;t know how to use the word &ldquo;our&rdquo; unless speaking in the majestic plural.</p>

<p><a href="https://ctmirror.org/category/ct-viewpoints/speak-no-evil-the-secret-to-keeping-connecticut-segregated/">Speak no evil: The secret to keeping Connecticut segregated</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One offered that Black people didn’t live here because “they” don’t like rural areas. Or because they can’t afford it. If Will Smith wanted to buy a house in town, he certainly could&hellip; Grown men actually argued that there was no segregation here, because the town would welcome the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not one person in this story would recognize or understand their actions as racist. They would be appalled if you used that word. And perhaps worse, as a result, not one of them would understand that their actions are a part of an entire system chipping away at Black people in America ever day of their lives in this, 2020. This is the use of that small-d democracy from earlier posts to create a system of oppression and deny it&ndash; to put ones knee on the neck of Black America and then claim that the knee never existed, no matter how many times we&rsquo;ve all seen the footage. This is the worst kind of racism, because it is so hard to eradicate even as it is so effective at stopping liberation.</p>

    <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/9011/9781250313225"> Harrow the Ninth </a>
  

 by Tamyn Muir.</p>

<p>I think this book broke my brain. It&rsquo;s everything I typically don&rsquo;t like, and I&rsquo;m still not positive I&rsquo;m sure what I read, and yet I devoured it. Rather than my confusion leading to frustration, I found it propulsive. I wanted every layer of unreliable narration on top of half-overhead statements by characters on top of non-linearity shellacked onto me as I was reshaped by reading this the way Harrowhawk can reshape her own bone.</p>

<p>What the fuck was that?</p>

<p>Please get Alecto the Ninth into my hands immediately.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>What have I done?</p>

<p>In my attempts to reduce <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/">doomscrolling</a> in this triple tsunami of <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu">pandemic</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/03/893190275/states-are-broke-and-many-are-eyeing-massive-cuts-heres-how-yours-is-doing">recession</a>, and election, I began subscribing to Twitter accounts in my RSS reader using <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a>.</p>

<p>The idea was, hey, it&rsquo;s really easy to choose just a few accounts. I want to actually see what these, say 50 people say, and make sure I don&rsquo;t miss things. But I can read these 50 outside of the algorithm, in a place that&rsquo;s harder to mash the retweet with comment button, in a place that won&rsquo;t encourage me to post and jump into The Discourse <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:discourse"><a href="#fn:discourse">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Two fucking hundred unread. 36 accounts, one day, two fucking hundred unread. Dread.</p>

<p>What have I done?</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want 200 things to read from across the day in chronological order. This feels like doomscrolling in a new place. Why are you all tweeting so much? Why can&rsquo;t I get rid of some of these accounts without a feeling of remorse?</p>

<p>So I did two things that helped make me feel sane. First, on many days, I just Mark All as Read and clear it out. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I&rsquo;ve read these posts are not. No one is checking. There&rsquo;s no penalty to opting out if it feels pointless, or overwhelming, or uninterested.</p>

<p>The second thing was more interesting. I thought a bit about how I organized my own webpage, chronological by day. I did this because I wanted my own stream of thoughts to be read in order. I want my first post of the day to be read first, and my last post to be read last. This is a personal blog, and the narrative on here is my life and there&rsquo;s no reason why looking at my blog that my life should be running in some bizarre reverse order.</p>

<p>So I sorted and read the Tweets I subscribed to the same way. Rather than putting each of the accounts in a Twitter folder and attempting to recreate a chronological feed, I instead pretended that each Twitter account was a blog, and I read those blogs in chronological order, person by person. And you know what? Their lives had narrative too. Reading their posts in order, together, and each account I followed this way had a narrative. It was not this mixed up jumbled feed of different thoughts and ideas and topics and voices coming at me all at once, whether reverse  chronological or algorithmically sorted. Instead, I was reading what people were writing.</p>

<p>And it turns out done like this, 200 posts can be churned through in tens of minutes. That includes me clicking over and reading full articles or blog posts that are linked to, one of the main reason I follow these accounts anyway.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s overwhelming and terrible about Twitter, what I contribute to that I hate so much, is the Twitter conversation. There are only a few true conversations each day worth following and paying attention to in my feed. Most of the time, what&rsquo;s actually quite nice about Twitter is that it&rsquo;s where people write microblogs. It&rsquo;s the ideas they&rsquo;re thinking about, stories they&rsquo;re telling, and great articles I would otherwise miss that they&rsquo;re sharing throughout the day.</p>

<p>I knew it back when Facebook introduced the News Feed, but I forgot about it over the last 14 years or so&ndash; the feed is the problem, not the posts and not the people.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When I first learned that Automattic ran a remote team on Wordpress, I thought that it was a crazy strange example of dogfooding. Of course, eventually I realized that was foolish&ndash; a CMS is a great tool, not unlike Basecamp or any other intranet, and could easily be used as an internal company knowledge base, project planning tool, and more.</p>

<p>Today <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/08/06/improve-your-remote-collaboration-with-p2/">Automattic has made P2 free</a>. My understanding is that P2 is a heavily custom theme (maybe even whole instance?) of Wordpress that is used to run all of their internal systems. Seems like a great idea, although I&rsquo;m surprised it took them this long to make it available.</p>

<p>I think Slack, and chat in general, is a dead end for collaboration. As excited as I was for tools to advance beyond IRC and have good work chat with mainstream acceptance, I&rsquo;ve come to realize overtime that Slack has gotten more wrong than right. At work, we&rsquo;ve started to mix in Basecamp over the last year as we implemented <a href="https://www.basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> for our product development strategy. It&rsquo;s pretty ok&ndash; the best thing about Basecamp is that it is reliable and inexpensive. But using Basecamp has really piqued my interest in non-chat, asynchronous-first ways of working on remote teams.</p>

<p>P2 just exposes one more way to do this kind of work, tried and tested by a very large company for over a decade. I hope we&rsquo;ll see many more tools like this.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page">Based on the data</a>, there&rsquo;s no question in my mind that NYC should be leading the country in showing us how to get back to in-person schooling, safely. Cases are clearly now at 100-200 per day, hospitalizations in the low tens, deaths in single digits in a city of millions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ok to start cautious&ndash; elementary school only, maybe even not a full 5 days a week. This isn&rsquo;t really supported by the data, but it&rsquo;s good to build confidence in procedures and confidence in parents. Show that you can do contact tracing when a student or teacher gets sick&ndash; it will happen. Show that you have a plan in place to respond to some event. But NYC is as safe for children as anywhere will be for quite some time.</p>

<p>Real political leadership in New York starts now. Cuomo and de Blasio fighting, among other things, disastrously delayed the initial coronavirus response. Since then, NYC has succeeded at a level only seen outside of the US at flattening their curve to as near 0 as is possible. That is in spite of the disaster forecasting of, frankly, ignorant media commentary about how density would be the end of New York. We should look at NYC&rsquo;s curve and recognize it as the global city it is&ndash; having faced uniquely horrific consequences of COVID-19 followed by success that is somewhat unique in the United States but common elsewhere. In the beginning, NYC unfortunately looked like Italy, but so to now, months into the crisis, NYC fortunately looks more like Italy.</p>

<p>It is time to say, &ldquo;We are going to reduce other forms of opening that we have successfully done for a period of time now to give schools a chance to ramp up. We want all NYC schools students to be able to safely enter classrooms, so we&rsquo;re going to reduce other forms of contact, ramp up schools in a deliberate manner, and then, having shown we can do this safely, re-open other parts of the city again. We&rsquo;re going to show the country that no one responds to crisis like New Yorkers do.&rdquo; It would work, and NYC would be better for it.</p>

<p>I have three core problems I&rsquo;d like to solve.</p>

<ol>
<li>I do not want my speakers to be on separately, ugly stands like they are.</li>
<li>I do want to be able to center my monitor&ndash; currently there is a not very helpful &ldquo;wire organization&rdquo; shelf that makes it so that I cannot clamp my monitor arm where I would need to in order to center the monitor.</li>
<li>I do not want seesaw style legs that take up so much room under the desk itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>The current dimensions of the desk are 67&rdquo; x 20&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The speakers have a large footprint &ndash; they are 8.5&rdquo; x 7&rdquo; x 12&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The wall the desk is up against is approximately 10 feet.</p>

<p>I have thought about doing a very large, 98&rdquo; desk that essentially takes up the wall using the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/karlby-countertop-walnut-veneer-70335212/">Ikea KARLBY countertop</a>, but everyone seems to think this is ridiculously large. They&rsquo;re not entirely wrong&ndash; at that length, I would need some kind of center support and/or metal bars down the center to avoid sagging. That seems no good.</p>

<p>Most of the &ldquo;hot&rdquo; desks are sit-stand desks like the <a href="https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-laminate.html">Fully Jarvis</a> or <a href="https://www.upliftdesk.com/adjustable-height-desks/">Uplift</a> (which Elsa has). I had a standing desk once before and found I really didn&rsquo;t use it. While I like the design and simplicity of these desks, paying for an adjustable height desk that will stay static feels a bit silly to me.</p>

<p>I have contacted a local furniture maker whose style I like, and they quoted me a very reasonable base price for a large desk that was quite reasonable&ndash; I just have to actually decide on designs.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s my dilemma&ndash; I don&rsquo;t know what the right size desk is! I am confident I don&rsquo;t want to go to the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; 30&rdquo; depth&ndash; my current 20&rdquo; is largely &ldquo;enough&rdquo;, and so while I could go to 24&rdquo;, 30&rdquo; seems bonkers to me. One idea I had was adding a 48&rdquo; shelf to the desk. This way my monitor could go on the shelf, so could my laptop, but my speakers could be on either side. The problem&ndash; this monitor has a 10&rdquo; deep &ldquo;foot&rdquo; to the base, which is enormous and why I put it on the monitor arm. A 10&rdquo; deep shelf seems ridiculous on a 24&rdquo; desk. That means still using the arm, which is not really compatible with having a shelf.</p>

<p>Here is an image to scale of a 72&rdquo; x 24&rdquo; desk, outlining my speakers, the monitor, my laptop stand, and the desk mat area. As you can see, while the geometry does allow everything to fit on this desk, I am not sure it will feel any larger. By adding 4&rdquo; in one dimension and 6&rdquo; in the other, I am adding 388 square inches (4*67 + 5*24). I take away 120 square inches by tossing on the two speakers. The 268 square inches of additional space, added all around, is just not that much. It would achieve all three goals, but I think would still feel a bit like a &ldquo;small&rdquo; desk in spite of its size because how large everything I&rsquo;m placing on it is.</p>

<p>Anyway, I would love for some advice. Is the above plan really the right size? Might I come to regret having to tuck my laptop behind my monitor? Is any larger simply unwieldy? Are their solutions I&rsquo;m not considering?</p>

<p>Help me buy a new desk.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/opinion/a-safety-net-thats-a-kafkaesque-mess.html"><p>Beneficiaries can keep additional assets and income by setting up a Plan to Achieve Self Support — a written plan that must be submitted to and approved by the agency — but doing so is sufficiently complex that only 568 people in the entire country made use of this option in 2018. Nor are benefits so generous that recipients have no need to work — the monthly federal S.S.I. payment for 2020 was a mere $783. While many states supplement this, recipients still face terrible poverty.</p>

<p>Keeping track of these arcane details would be difficult for anyone. For low-income adults with intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses, who make up most working S.S.I. recipients, it is nearly impossible. Failure to do so can have awful consequences. The agency often overpays working disabled recipients, only to notify them that they must pay back thousands of dollars, sometimes years after the fact.</p></blockquote>

<p>We work remarkably hard at making government impossible to navigate for people who need and deserve our assistance, and then use that remarkable mess as an excuse to allow government to do nothing else. The mess is designed, not inevitable.</p>

In fact, employers hiring in STEM fields penalized résumés with minority or female names. The effect was big: These candidates were penalized by the equivalent of 0.25 GPA points, based solely on the name at the top of the résumé. That meant such a candidate needed a 4.0 GPA to get the same rating as a white male with a 3.75.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/25/immigration-documentary-trump-threats-block/112387528/"><p>Some of the contentious scenes include ICE officers lying to immigrants to gain access to their homes and mocking them after taking them into custody. One shows an officer illegally picking the lock to an apartment building during a raid.</p>

<p>At town hall meetings captured on camera, agency spokesmen reassured the public that the organization’s focus was on arresting and deporting immigrants who had committed serious crimes. But the filmmakers observed numerous occasions in which officers expressed satisfaction after being told by supervisors to arrest as many people as possible, even those without criminal records.</p>

<p>“Start taking collaterals, man,” a supervisor in New York said over a speakerphone to an officer who was making street arrests as the filmmakers listened in. “I don’t care what you do, but bring at least two people,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are we better off not knowing the details of what&rsquo;s popular and what is not? Part of me wants to believe that box office transparency became self-reinforcing&ndash; things became popular because they were popular, which could be bought to some degree, and therefore, smaller, high quality movies weren&rsquo;t getting made. Popular movies were memetic and spreading somehow through their economics and not their quality. Another part of me thinks that the &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; hits that perform much better than expected and then reap massive rewards are an important part of finding and rewarding the folks that make quality culture.</p>

<p>Mostly I think that gifs will always reveal how popular something actually is and ensure it spreads. Unless you&rsquo;re Quibi.</p>

Boston, by contrast, has to do all of the above: extensive retrofits, decarbonize its grid, install lots of heat pumps, and have solar panels on 40 percent of its homes.

         	<p><a href="https://www.city-journal.org/liberty-government-preservation-of-civil-society">Never has a piece so completely failed to engage with its actual critics</a>&ndash; the side stepping done here on the actual impact on protection from discrimination is incredible.</p>

<p>A Black poor student is being served by a Catholic School with government support because the public system has been starved of resources by regressive state tax schemes compounded by new exit rights for individuals starving the system further. They happen to be non-cis gendered. Their state mandated and supported education now denies their identity and their ability to practice that identity because religious groups define membership. Their teacher, who teaches math, turns out to be non-binary and fired because during period 1 math they say a prayer.</p>

<p>The only black member of the entire school staff wants to teach 
  
    <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/9011/9781620971932">The New Jim Crow</a>
  

 in their social studies class, and as a result is fired, because the teacher is a lunch monitor and grace is said before meals. The state pays to teach them there is a scientific, rather than political, controversy on climate change and evolution. They are unable to request the use of accurate pronouns. When they are bullied and harassed about their gender, they are told they are in the wrong.</p>

<p>They are a minor. They are placed where their parents demand. Their options are limited, because the system has been designed to hollow out all other options. They are not empowered to choose their association or membership at all.</p>

<p>What if they are Jewish?</p>

<p>Religious groups should get to choose their membership and teach their doctrine, freely. Their entanglement in public purposes, with public money, involving minors is their choice. What the courts have done is secured the rights of religious groups over all individual rights.</p>

<p>If these groups solely engaged in voluntary religious activity with their own money and purposes, I’d have concerns, but they&rsquo;d be minor. When they are engaging in state mandated education with state money in areas where there’s no functional choice… well.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman">The Lemon Test</a> is a good standard and we should take excessive government entanglement seriously. Unfortunately, our response is to allow religious groups to do whatever they want <em>on behalf of the state</em> because they are religious, rather than excise religion from state action.</p>

<p>I love civil society. I have the same small c conservative appreciation for volunteer association and lots of distrust of large, concentrated power and coordination. But this reframing of the conversation is too divorced from the critical reality</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Every time the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/508259-ocaasio-cortez-accosted-by-gop-lawmaker-over-remarks-that-kind-of">House GOP and right wing media attacks Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez</a>, they make her so much stronger. There&rsquo;s a special hatred that is seething among them, and they have to believe they are playing somehow to their base supporters by going after a young, left, Latina congresswoman. But they also seem to think they can reach beyond the base of people who are afraid of her just due to her identity.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the right has seized on AOC also in part because they want to appeal to me. I’m exactly the kind of cosmopolitan, well-educated, elite, male, white liberal that is set up to bristle at someone like AOC rising in the ranks due to her &ldquo;fame&rdquo; more than her accomplishments. And yet, the right just raises my estimation of her every time she overcomes their bile.</p>

<p>Who is AOC other than a safe congresswoman on the left end of the party? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m supposed to think. But then the right coordinates merciless attacks against her, and she just rises above the mountain of shit they sling, with grace, humor, strength, and, importantly, the kind of humility they are desperate to prove does not exist.</p>

<p>Without the right wing scorched earth campaign against her, I would be waiting 10 years to see if she can build coalitions and pass laws, demonstrating she&rsquo;s more than a charismatic politician. Instead, she&rsquo;s been tested for leadership and she keeps passing the test.</p>

<p>I don’t view her as a freshman congresswoman. The right did that.</p>

         	<p>A functioning country would at least have a political conversation about this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1692626">vast increase in government surveillance</a>. This is why it’s not paranoia to be worried about mass troves of private data or privatization of government functions.</p>

<p>I have no idea if we should, ulimately, make a stink about this. The point is that private data very quickly can be used and sold for other purposes, including government surveillance. We can’t have solid vehicle-mile taxes, supposedly because of surveillance concerns. Yet private providers roam the streets, collect data on where you are, and hand that over to the national government already. The actual surveillance state is already here, and we have given into it for parking tickets.</p>

<p>At the same time, potentially good policy like VMT is blocked for privacy concerns.</p>

<p>Why? Policy is explicit.</p>

         	<p>Sarah Jeong, unsurprisingly, get&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s internet controversy completely right in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320338/letter-harpers-writers-free-speech-canceled-social-media-illiberalism">Letterheads: Social media and the end of discourse</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all its pretense to logic and debate above all else, the old paradigm bred an irrational and incomprehensibly unjust society. The opinionators frequently circulated debunked or faulty science, and they kept alive a “debate” around climate change that has not existed among scientists for decades. They tolerated the intolerant and treated dehumanization as a difference of opinion. They were — despite being held as the paragons of rational discourse — never particularly rational. One only needs to point to the war in Iraq as proof of that.</p>

<p>As a first principle, history cannot be equated with comfort, nostalgia, or a fixed arc of progress. We need to get the facts right; otherwise, we are trading only in what Du Bois called “lies agreed upon.” In particular, we can’t elide the facts that complicate how we might see a historical figure or event. Washington held slaves, and he didn’t treat them very well. Jefferson wrote brilliantly about democracy, and he also owned slaves, exploited Sally Hemings, the enslaved mother of his children, and wondered aloud if black people were biologically inferior. The record shows this to be true.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I was fortunate enough to spend time with my parents this July 4th weekend when this <a href="https://twitter.com/spencercompton/status/1279579382793875459?s=21">video</a> of protestors in Baltimore pulling down Christopher Columbus’s statue went viral. First, because it happened to be Spencer’s video, a good friend from high school <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:bmore"><a href="#fn:bmore">1</a></sup>, and so it caught their attention, and second because they asked me why people were tearing down Columbus’s statue. What’s wrong with Columbus?</p>

<p>The thing is, my parents both have voted for democrats my entire life. Their politics have consistently been center-left. My fiancé is half Haitian. They should know about Columbus and how he treated the Taino on Hispaniola. They should, but they don’t. Because although I had classroom conversations about <em>Christopher Columbus: Hero or Villain</em>, they did not. When they were in school in the 60s and 70s, Columbus was a fully fictionalized, canonized, rehabilitated hero of American folklore. While controversy over Columbus’s legacy has shown up in campus newspapers, short local news stories, and opinions pieces each year in October, it’s easy to miss, forget, and ignore.</p>

<p>When we keep monuments to historical figures in every major city, the controversy is drowned out by the ubiquity. These monuments do not cause us to wrestle with history, they allow us to ignore it. We assume the presence of these celebrations are endorsements, and they make it seem as though the controversy is out of the mainstream and unimportant. We can live on with the folklore, because if things were really terrible, why would there be a statue in every city?</p>

<p>These statues must come down. There is no contextualization that will cause folks passing by to grapple with history when they see these bronzed men staring down from their pedestals. Tearing them down has already caused more conversation about the legacies of these individuals than the statues that dot this country.</p>

<p>Don’t mistake the statue for the history. The statues themselves are modern, and they don’t mark a significant history themselves. They are the constructed folklore of America constructed, a physical manifestation of an ahistorical narrative meant to build national, white pride. We can learn about the canonization of Columbus and the discrimination of Italian-Americans without maintaining public monuments throughout our cities. We can keep a few in a museum, and talk about Columbus not as some grand explorer who “discovered” an occupied land and started centuries of theft and slavery, but instead as a flawed man lifted from obscurity and shame to generate pride among another people who were being mistreated by the dominant white, protestant American nationalists.</p>

<p>The statues must come down. They celebrate a rebellion to maintain slavery. They were built not as monuments to shame, nor as monuments to history. These largely 20th century inventions are a justification for the South and the United States as a whole to continue to refuse to have any kind of truth and reconciliation or reparations for the sins of their nation. It was about not feeling the shame and defeat, but instead restoring pride <em>in their actions to subjugate, past and present, black people</em>.</p>

<p>We don’t need to celebrate these people. We don’t need to cling to imagined heroes that we created to reinforce narratives we need to shed. We don’t need these statues.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In April of 2018, Elsa and I visited Hong Kong for the first time. It now seems likely that this will be the last time we will have visited Hong Kong. It&rsquo;s certainly true that if we ever return, we will be entering a very different place.</p>

<p>Visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Museum_of_History">Hong Kong Museum of History</a> was an important experience. I better understood the brutal conditions of colonialism in Hong Kong and the complexity of reunification with China. But I remember even then having the sense that the political situation in Hong Kong was untenable&ndash; how can individuals invest so massively in a place whose future, in a thirty year timeframe, was so uncertain? Why wasn&rsquo;t there more demand for democracy or for a longer term resolution on Hong Kong sovereignty? Are people really just going to wait it out?</p>

<p>I recognize that these were privileged, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird">WEIRD</a> thoughts, and I did feel the subtle complexities that challenged my more simple confusion.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel prescient that things have escalated to the violent, authoritarian extreme that it has in Hong Kong so rapidly from then. I feel sad.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/24/magazine/reparations-slavery.html?action=click">Read every word of Nikole Hannah Jone&rsquo;s piece on reparations</a>, but a few pull outs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As part of the New Deal programs, the federal government created redlining maps, marking neighborhoods where black people lived in red ink to denote that they were uninsurable. As a result, 98 percent of the loans the Federal Housing Administration insured from 1934 to 1962 went to white Americans, locking nearly all black Americans out of the government program credited with building the modern (white) middle class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my answer, consistently, to the people I grew up with who were largely White, European immigrants to the US in this period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reparations should include a commitment to vigorously enforcing existing civil rights prohibitions against housing, educational and employment discrimination, as well as targeted investments in government-constructed segregated black communities and the segregated schools that serve a disproportionate number of black children. But critically, reparations must include individual cash payments to descendants of the enslaved in order to close the wealth gap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too many folks focus on the cash payments, which should be made. But it&rsquo;s important to realize that a large part of reparations is about race-conscious investment. For example, there&rsquo;s no world in which <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/04/21/how-you-can-tell-larry-hogans-decision-to-kill-the-red-line-was-racial-discrimination/">Baltimore&rsquo;s Red Line should have been cancelled in favor of the Purple Line</a>, and a part of reparations should be the legal and policy structure to make the reverse decision.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/climate/climate-seas-30-year-mortgage.html">This great piece in the New York Times</a> points out that banks are already requiring higher down payments on houses in coastal flood zones in anticipation of rising sea levels due to climate change. Even buyers are increasingly taking &ldquo;interest only loans&rdquo;, where they are a building 0 equity, presumably because they believe that the home will be worth nothing, shortly.</p>

<p>The changes are modest, but starting. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are still backstopping these mortgages, under the guise that flood insurance is a sufficient protection, but the reality is many homes in the US, and therefore quite a bit of property value and household wealth, will be destroyed in the next 50 years.</p>

<p>What can we do from a policy perspective? With our politics utterly polarized on the belief of science, the government seems unable to begin to price in the costs of climate change to protect our economy and provide a true <em>caveat emptor</em> to homebuyers. I expect that the debate of the 2040 election might be which wealthy people get a bailout due to climate change destroying their homes and wealth.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect to be sympathetic.</p>

         	<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after this constitution was written, Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the C.S.A., offered a political manifesto for the slaveholders’ new republic. Training his sights on the eight upper-South states that were still refusing to secede, he offered a blunt assessment of the difference between the old Union and the new. The original American Union “rested upon the assumption of the equality of the races,” he explained. But “our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas: its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery is his natural … condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based on this great … truth.” A statue of Alexander Stephens now stands in the U.S. Capitol; it is one of a group that includes Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, targeted for removal.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://json.blog/2020/06/20/the-perfect-time.html">The Perfect Time for Vacancy Taxes</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://json.blog/2020/06/20/the-perfect-time.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-06-20 15:25:17 -0400">Jun 20, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Now feels like a good time for cities to impose massive penalties on vacant properties and storefronts. They should ensure that no landlord has cause to believe property is worth more empty, waiting out higher rent.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how we save what restaurants, cafes, and independent shops we have. That&rsquo;s how we make sure those that don&rsquo;t survive are more likely to be constructively replaced with new businesses and opportunities as we navigate a long recovery from the current recession.</p>

<p>If the result is that some properties lose tremendous value, well, these are properties whose value is tied to the urban fabric itself being valuable. The harm done to these specific developers and their specific banks and investors is far smaller and more just than the harm done to the future business owners, the residents of cities, and the future developers and bankers who are ready to put spaces to productive use.</p>

<p>The other side of this is a huge government problem in some cities&ndash; it can be incredibly hard to open a business in most cities. Taxes collected from vacancies should first and foremost go toward improving the systems&ndash; technical and bureaucratic&ndash; and process for filling these properties.</p>

<p>City councils should pass the new taxes/fees alongside reforms to remove onerous neighborhood notifications and other &ldquo;veto&rdquo; points toward opening a new business in a storefront. These changes should be universal, not just for vacant property. The Great Streamlining should include everything from getting a business license, to zoning reviews (and simplified zoning!), through construction permitting. The only &ldquo;expediters&rdquo; necessary should be city employees doing their jobs in the normal course of business. Anything less is a failure.</p>

<p>Crises are great clarifiers. Each one creates massive problems that need solving. Sometimes those problems are brand new and will require new thinking. But often crises serve to push hard on existing fault lines and pressure points that reformers and activists have pointed at for years as systemic failures. Many of our great cities have failed at being great places to do business and have failed to keep vacancies down as rent went up.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have to keep failing.</p>

         	<p>You should read <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/9011/9780674980860">Policing the Open Road</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/suspect-citizens/A399F1EEA04CFCFC18D750AC0095AD96">Suspect Citizens</a>, but if you won&rsquo;t you should at least read the conclusion from Suspect Citizens available for free at the link provided.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a choice, long excerpt about traffic stop data in North Carolina:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, after eighteen years of data collection have assembled over 20 million observations, we can report that a two-to-one disparity, far from being an aberration, is in fact the statewide average; many police agencies are much more disparate in their treatment of black motorists. And, as we showed in Chapter 7, these disparities are not limited to blacks; Hispanics are also much more likely to be searched and arrested than whites&hellip;</p>

<p>Another key element of our findings is that these tactics do not appear to have any readily apparent crime-fighting benefits. When contraband is discovered it is almost always in small amounts, so much so that the typical contraband “hit” does not even lead to an arrest. To boot, those demographic groups that are most likely to experience a search (young minority men) are actually less likely to be found with contraband. Hispanics in particular are much more likely to be subjected to “fruitless search” than whites or blacks. When we look at the behaviors associated with each police officer, we find no correlation between a propensity to search and the propensity to find contraband, suggesting that there are no overarching standards, that training does not produce a clear profile of when to search, and that it may well be an idiosyncratic guessing game, with each officer using his or her own judgment.</p>

<p>Traffic stops can certainly be a traffic safety tool, and we have shown that when officers focus on traffic safety, the racial disparities apparent in the outcomes of those stops are greatly reduced. Disparities are higher when officers use the rules of the road as a pretext to pull over those drivers who attract their attention for reasons unrelated to the safety of their driving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, traffic enforcement is all about the suspension of the Fourth Amendment, just as Policing the Open Road frames it. Cops are stopping people of color, using those stops as a pretext for searches that would be illegal in any other context, and those searches are failing to turn up much illegal activity. The reality is that traffic enforcement is not about safety, but instead about using state power to intimidate Black and Hispanic people.</p>

<p>The goals of traffic enforcement do not require police, and the actions of police do not support those goals. We need to decriminalize <strong>and</strong> remove policing from them. Departments of Transportation can handle traffic enforcement, using cameras and, when necessary, patrols of non-armed civil servants. We can end the threat of search or seizure or physical abuse on the roads entirely in favor of simple citations and providing assistance.</p>

<p>We should defund the police, and traffic enforcement is a great place to start.</p>

<p>The effect of that is to produce yet another battery of crime statistics coming out of Northern cities that shows high rates of arrest of black people during the Prohibition period, when in fact, they’re being targeted for political clampdowns of overwhelmingly white underground activity. It’s just remarkable.</p>

<p>We have so throughly criminalized human activity that all cops have to do is focus on Black people to generate the data that back’s up the belief that Black criminality is the problem.</p>

<p>In the 1890s. And again in the 1920s. And again in the 1960s. And again in the 1990s. And again today. These aren’t waves or events strung together by history. They are a single, constant, concerted effort to maintain the slavery that built our nation.</p>

         	<p>Today might have gone differently.</p>

<p>Greet a few friends with a hug as we arrive. Meander to the bar for a drink while we wait to get seated. Order a round of oysters. Get to our table, refresh our drinks, order more of our favorites from the oysters we had at the bar. Maybe a couple of recommended starters. We&rsquo;ll figure out the rest later. On drink three we decide it&rsquo;s worth ordering at least one or two entrées for the table to share. Another round of drinks. Struggle to share a dessert. A digestif to end the evening. No fuss about it being my birthday, but still a time with a few friends and great food.</p>

<p>This year I sat at home. We ordered in pizza. The world watched America demonstrate it is a white supremacist state. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/us/george-floyd-new-video-officers-kneel-trnd/index.html">The police murder instead of protect</a>.

<p>Pooling local revenue with Baltimore City&rsquo;s two nearest neighbors results in $3,717 more funding per student for BCPSS students.</p>

<p>If we pooled the whole state, that increase grows to $4,963.</p>

<p>Without including wealthy DC suburbs or the Eastern Shore of Maryland, roughly 75% of the gap in funding for Baltimore City is covered just by stepping across a border designed for segregation.</p>

<p>75% of the gap.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the legacy of state sponsored segregation. That&rsquo;s what you choose when you live over the border.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I used to be a heavy Google Reader user. Besides the joy of going one place and reading my whole internet, I took a lot of pleasure in sharing great things from around the web with friends. Some of this happened within Reader, but mostly I was a prolific emailer in college of interesting things.</p>

<p>I miss the correspondence my friends and I had over email about interesting block posts or stories or funny things I found all about the internet. It was one of the joys of email, and the joys of leisure time.</p>

<p>I continue this practice somewhat today— if you’re unfortunate enough to be a close friend you probably get some combination of iMessage, Twitter DMs, Instagram messages, or Slack messages about the things I find. But it’s all scattered and sent through highly disruptive mechanism.</p>

<p>I don’t really like to link blog because half the fun is curating who I send things to. And I miss spontaneous groupings of my friends who might like the same things.</p>

<p>I think within all this is an inkling of an idea for a web app/service only useful to me that I’d like to write. If I could collect interesting things in a queue almost like Buffer, and then at a set interval, empty that queue. It would send off a custom email to each person collating the items I selected to share with them. The result is almost a newsletter, but actually a collection of “fun things Jason thought you’d like or would love to talk with you about”.</p>

<p>I think I could maintain a lot more of my friendships with this package. In many ways, sharing the fun stuff I find on the web or debating a news article or blog with you, probably because I thought you’d have interesting things to say or it would challenge your thinking in some way, is my love language.</p>

         	<p>I have been waiting for about 2 years for a coffee shop to open around the corner.</p>

<p>They’ll “open” for pickup only for the first time Wednesday.</p>

<p>It’s heartbreaking to think about someone pouring their savings and time into opening up shop only for a global pandemic to hit.</p>

<p>I don’t think we’ve come close to grappling with the lives lost, and we certainly haven’t understood the economic devastation caused by the twin diseases of COVID-19 and an utterly failed government.</p>

<p>It’s Memorial Day in the US. We are supposed to honor and grapple with the sacrifice of soldiers lost at war today. In reality, we celebrate their deaths with cookouts and sales. I can’t help but feel the parallelism in our failures to understand the cost of war and our failures to take seriously this pandemic. The numbers are too large to understand. The costs incalculable. Scale overwhelms and whites out our ability to perceive.</p>

<p>So I think about this coffee shop. It was someone’s dream. It was their big risk that they hoped would define their life. “I have decide to be a coffee shop owner.” Now, through no fault of their own, their grand opening will involve masks, gloves, and paper cups passing quietly across a door frame. Instead of hearing, for the first time, that glorious din of pen to paper, fingers on keys, friends talking, glasses clinking, milk steaming, and the cheery greetings between staff and regulars, they’ll open quietly.</p>

<p>They may not survive long enough to be what they hoped. Neither might we.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I missed it by a couple of days.</p>

<p>After years of conflicting advise and being bounced from specialist to specialist for keratoconus, I finally seemed to have found a set of doctors I trusted and who gave me a solid course of action.</p>

<p>The news was not great&ndash; the scarring on my left eye was fairly severe, dead center. My right now, now also presenting with keratoconus could not receive corneal cross-linking, a promising laser-based treatment to temper the progression of keratoconus, because my left eye vision was so poor the risks outweighed the benefits.</p>

<p>The hope? Improve the left eye, hopefully before summer, so that I could get corneal cross-linking before the right eye got as bad as the left. How would we do this? After years of not having corrected/correctable vision in that eye and all blur, it was time to take seriously my need for a partial corneal transplant. My hope had always been to avoid this, because I&rsquo;m young, there are risks, they don&rsquo;t last forever, and artificial corneas seem just years away.</p>

<p>This latest doctor though gave me some hope&ndash; they would be willing to do the partial transplant, but first they insisted I try scleral lenses. I had been offered lenses in the past, but with caveats. I was told they were expensive, that my keratoconus was so severe they&rsquo;d need to order whole new fitting kits, and that the likelihood was I&rsquo;d get only modest vision improvement. My new doctor said that she thought we&rsquo;d have much better luck focusing through (around?) the scarring. That if she could get me to 20/40 vision with the lenses, we would have some options to do a &ldquo;scrape&rdquo; to try and remove the scar tissue instead of a full transplant.</p>

<p>This whole course of action was a bit time bound&ndash; we wanted to see if we can&rsquo;t get to the crosslinking before the right eye got worse and risked scarring.</p>

<p>And of course, my follow up was the first week of quarantine.</p>

<p>Today, I got to go to that follow up appointment. And to my delight and surprise (and even to my doctor&rsquo;s surprise), we did better than 20/40 with the scleral lens. For the first time in 5 years, not only could I make out shapes with my left eye, I achieved a &ldquo;blurry 20/20”.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m frustrated. I have had doctor&rsquo;s telling me about scleral lenses for years, but making clear that I should only expect modest improved vision and that it was a pain in the butt and expensive. They are expensive. And I don&rsquo;t know yet how much of a pain in the ass they&rsquo;ll be. But at least for now, I won&rsquo;t need a transplant and starting in a few weeks, I&rsquo;ll be using <em>both</em> of my eyes to see again.</p>

<p><em>What I&rsquo;m thinking about and working on right now. This page will be updated semi-regularly as seems appropriate. The post date reflects when this was updated, and all Now pages will be archived and linked to from this page.</em></p>

<p>Here we are in 2020 facing down COVID-19 and expecting to spend the next several weeks if not months primarily at home. Luckily, we have a <a href="https://www.json.blog/2020/03/17/new-covid-workspace.html">room in our home I was able to turn into an office</a>, and I can comfortably work from here. Still, it&rsquo;s hard to stay productive and keep my fears and anxiety even as we face so much uncertainty. For now, I&rsquo;m taking some solace in the fact that I can continue to work, I am safe, and my family is safe. But I am afraid that a lot of change is coming, and it won&rsquo;t result in a safer and better world&ndash; that&rsquo;s the kind of too-honest, invasive thinking that I&rsquo;m hoping to ignore for at least a little longer.</p>

<p>I not-so-recently <a href="https://www.json.blog/2020/01/01/the-first-ten.html">got engaged</a>.</p>

<p>I had spend the last couple of years working out quite diligently, lifting weights three times a week about 80% of the time and twice a week the remainder. In the end, although I enjoyed it, my inability to control my eating saw my weight and health decline to where I wasn&rsquo;t happy. I started counting calories again and I&rsquo;m seeing results I feel good about. I&rsquo;m going to try and reintroduce exercise now that things feel a bit more under control, and I&rsquo;m hoping to have finally turned a corner on a lifelong battle with weight. I&rsquo;ve done better than I&rsquo;m doing now before, but this time feels easier and more sustainable than it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>

<p>Some of that is helped by <a href="https://jezebel.com/my-obsession-with-the-bon-appetit-cinematic-universe-1839497437">my obsession with the Bon Appétit cinematic universe</a>, which has me enjoying cooking again, something I lost with the move from Providence to Baltimore. It&rsquo;s kind of amazing, but the stress of the year we moved combined with spending a year in a kitchen that felt cramped really hurt my enjoyment of cooking. But slowly in the last two and a half years since we moved to our current house, I&rsquo;ve felt more and more interested in being in the kitchen and eating food we make again. It&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>

<p>And in truth, as difficult as this period of social distancing will be, the end of work travel for a prolonged period of time for the first time in six years means that routines are going to be easier to build and easier to keep than ever before. I miss the travel&ndash; a lot&ndash; but if I have to create some kind of silver lining, I think it has to be that routine feels possible again.</p>

         	<p>We hastily moved some things around at home in preparation for both of us needing to work from home full time for the foreseeable future. I still have a lot of work to do in this room, especially considering we started to move post-isolation protocol time, but thought I&rsquo;d share a look at my current desk setup</p>

<p>Some notable gear:</p>

<ul>
<li>13&rdquo; MacBook Pro (about 3 years old now)</li>
<li>LG 5K monitor</li>
<li>Amazon Basics monitor arm</li>
<li>ScanSnap S1300i</li>
<li>Ergodox EZ Keyboard with Godspeed MiTO MT3 keycaps</li>
<li>Logitech MX Master 3</li>
<li>Rode boom arm</li>
<li>Audio Technica ATR 2100 microphone</li>
<li>Kanto YU5 speakers</li>
<li>Philips Fidelio X2 headphones</li>
<li>Steelcase Gesture chair</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s some stuff not pictured key to my home technology setup, including a Synology 1810+ disk station and Ubiquiti networking gear.</p>

<p>The wiring is a mess, but overall, this set up has worked quite well for the past few days. When I am at my office, I bring the Ergodox and the laptop and that&rsquo;s it&ndash; I have an LG 5K there and MX Master 3 there as well so my setup is fairly &ldquo;drop in&rdquo;. I also use my Sony WH1000XM2 headphones there since the office is loud. Ideally, I would have a second Ergodox, a second boom and ATR2100, and a better pair of closed-backed headphones, but I can&rsquo;t complain.</p>

<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s the guitars (pedalboard and Weber Mass 50 attenuator not pictured) that I have behind me in case I need to unwind for a bit.</p>

         	<p>I think it’s fun and funny to joke about delaying a task you dread only to have it take far less time than you expect. I just posted about that the other day.</p>

<p>But the truth is, problem solving is hard cognitive work and all that time in dread was my brain wrestling with the problem on some background cycles.</p>

<p>If I got started right away, the task would be tedious and hard, and I may not come to an answer I’m comfortable with. The right time to solve a problem is when it comes surprisingly easy and feels like the “right” way to do something.</p>

<p>In truth, I celebrate that I am getting better at identifying the right time and conditions to sit and work on a problem and seeing an elegant solution unfold quickly.</p>

<p>What I am struggling with is not feeling so bad during the waiting period when I haven’t quite figured out what to do yet.</p>

         	<p>A lot of white people in America who don’t support progressive taxes, and don’t support various ways government can redistribute wealth point to one thing: they have earned what is theirs. When we talk about reparations— they didn’t own slaves.</p>

<p>How many of them know the history of their wealth?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/widening-racial-wealth-gap-baltimore-edmondson-village-rodgers-forge/31020226">This story</a> about two Baltimore neighborhoods is just one small example of how explicit government policy and action created and sustained a racial wealth divide just a generation or two ago.</p>

<p>Because I grew up in the New York City tri-state area, I frequently heard from people whose families, like mine, emigrated to the US with little, long after slavery. These immigrants and their descendants made clear that because they didn’t participate in slavery or the Jim Crow South and they came to the US with little, they had no reason to have to pay taxes that supported black people in America to correct for our original sin. It seemed preposterously unfair.</p>

<p>They were and are blind to the ways their own family wealth in America was created and supported through explicitly racist policy programs that lead to affordable home ownership for their families. They have benefited from white supremacy all the same.</p>

<p>After the final version of SAFE is published, it will go to the courts. Its odds of survival are unclear. Historically, regulatory agencies win about 70 percent of their court challenges, Lienke said. Yet under the Trump administration, agencies have lost more than 90 percent of their cases, according to an ongoing tally from the Institute for Policy Integrity.</p>

<p>Many of those losses came in cases like this one, in which agencies published false, misleading, or fundamentally erroneous explanations of their own rules. In June, the Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could not add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, because the Department of Commerce’s internal motivations did not match its publicly stated reasoning.</p>

<p>Agencies must “offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion. “The explanation provided here was more of a distraction.”</p>

They were not the top talents in this field. These are script kiddies who grabbed tons of data and implemented freely available methods and algorithms to build a terrifying product.</p>

<p>Scraping is not an advantage— any government (or private) actor can easily construct the same database. Training their dataset requires the know-how to implement published models and algorithms, which is not a unique enough skill to protect us.</p>

<p>We need to move past attempts to stop our technology from invading our privacy in this way&ndash; we&rsquo;re way too late&ndash; and move on to finding ways to protect ourselves given this new reality.</p>

<p>We all need to adjust our threat models to assume our faces and photos are public and easy to access for anyone who wants to target us as individuals. Adopt new laws, policy, and personal security practices for this world.</p>

<p>I remember the disappointment I felt when I realized the stars of science fiction would probably remain unreachable, and that it wasn&rsquo;t really clear that those we might reach some day would be worth visiting.</p>

<p>The last 10 or 15 years of astrophysics and planet hunting has thoroughly dispelled the idea that our solar system is one of a kind. It’s one of the most exciting discoveries made in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Our schools can be improved. In too many places, the quality of instruction and quality of operations is far from great. I don&rsquo;t think we have to <em>fix poverty to fix schools</em>.</p>

<p>But if we shift focus to quality outcomes for kids and not quality systems of education, it&rsquo;s quickly intolerable that one in six kids live in poverty, many more live on the margins, and our social safety net is as byzantine as it is inadequate.</p>

<p>My life will be defined by the last decade. How could it not be? In 2010 I graduated from a fifth-year master’s program and entered the workforce full time for the first time. Elsa and I started dating in 2010 as well. I began both my career and family life with the decade.</p>

<p>These were the first ten years of my adult life.</p>

<h2 id="2012">2012</h2>

<p>In 2012, I quit my first job and started a fellowship with like-minded education data professionals. For the first time, I had a meaningful professional network. I left my first job for all the right reasons. I had learned a lot but could see no opportunities for growth or change on the horizon. My boss would hold his job for at least another 7 and maybe 10 years. I wasn’t sure I’d want his job anyway. I was trusted and respected, and already had opportunities to work in almost all parts of the organization and choose the projects I wanted to contribute to. I had a great job, but it would be that same job forever. Meanwhile, three years out from finishing my undergraduate degree and a couple of years out from graduate school, I saw many of my classmates switching jobs into new and exciting opportunities that they came across through the professional networks they were building. I was building no network— we had no money for professional development, a complete travel ban unless required as a part of a grant, and I worked in a state agency in a small state. It a was hard decision— I did enjoy my job, but I needed to leave to grow.</p>

<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>

<p>In 2013, I struggled professionally. I left a supportive, if limited, environment and found myself unready for the rigors of independence. I had two bosses in two different organizations, both of whom saw me as self-motivated and self-reliant, My work was largely long term projects. I went from working in a cubicle on many small projects always on a team to working alone in a quiet office or from home if I chose to do so. While I had a professional community through my fellowship, in many ways, my daily professional life was quiet and lonely. I made steady progress but had a hard time building day to day motivation. I had long thought I might get a Ph.D., but it became horrifyingly clear that managing an independent, long term research project was draining, not invigorating. I enjoyed teaching and being a part of an academic community, but I knew the long odds of getting a tenure track position. Now joining academia not only seemed unobtainable but also undesirable. What was I going to do?</p>

<h2 id="2014">2014</h2>

<p>In 2014, I asked a question that changed my life, leading me to meet Jess and become one of Allovue’s first employees. I still can’t quite believe the series of events that conspired to put us in a room together that day, for me to ask a conference panel a question, for her to hand me her card, and for me to know just enough to realize that a once in a lifetime opportunity fell in my lap. I met my future boss, mentor, and a dear friend through a chance encounter 2000 miles from home. During my interview, Jess told me she saw “C-level potential” in me. I didn’t understand what she meant, or what she saw in me that I did not see in myself. I guess she was right, a pattern that continues until today, because&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="2015">2015</h2>

<p>In 2015 I became the Chief Product Officer. I formally left behind a role defined by data analysis to one defined by product management. I am not sure I knew what product management meant. I’m still figuring that out. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ted"><a href="#fn:ted">1</a></sup> That summer, we released our first product, Manage. The night before a major product demo and our &ldquo;announcing&rdquo; we were in the market with our first customer, everything was broken. I was shaking I was so nervous. At every moment, it felt like I was about to be more proud of what we had accomplished than of any other thing I have done in my whole career or like we were about to fail in some irrecoverable way and this ride would be over. We got it fixed, it worked, we made our first critical sales, and Jess was able to raise our Series A round that fall.</p>

<h2 id="2016">2016</h2>

<p>In 2016, a family health issue led us to leave Providence and moving to Baltimore, where Allovue is based. Elsa&rsquo;s mom moved in with us and brought along with her our second dog, Brandy. Moving was hard. We had just completed redoing our kitchen and bathroom and everything at our condo was just how we liked it. Although Elsa decided to leave her job and was looking for work, the last two years we had started to feel established in our community in Providence. We had solid personal and professional supports. Providence became the home we built together, but it was time to go. In retrospect, I&rsquo;m glad we left.</p>

<h2 id="2017">2017</h2>

<p>In 2017, we lost my grandfather. I turned 30, and I started to take working out more seriously because years of work travel and neglect made me feel bad. I wanted to get back some of the healthy habits I had built a few years prior when Elsa and I both lost a fair amount of weight. Allovue&rsquo;s CTO Ted left, and I was put in charge of development in addition to design, product management, and data integration. Although we weathered that initial transition well, I think it&rsquo;s only in 2019 that I truly began to feel comfortable with my new role. We also released our first version of our Budget tool, our second major software product. We bought our house in Hampden, Baltimore. For the first time, we have enough room for family and friends to visit and stay with us and we can host holidays. I love our new home and we&rsquo;re building a nice life here. Some of my heart remains in Providence, but Baltimore is nudging its way in. I still don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;ve built the strong emotional ties to Baltimore I had for Providence, but I&rsquo;d like to get there someday.</p>

<h2 id="2018">2018</h2>

<p>In 2018, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, my Uncle Doug died. I left two weeks later for a wonderful trip with Elsa and visited East Asia for the first time. When I came home, my grandmother had passed away. A month later, my Uncle Marty, who lived with me throughout my childhood, was gone as well. It was the worst two months of my life. The rest of this year is a blur.</p>

What I see when I look at this fridge is all of the food we need for our holidays and the happy memories of celebrating at my house. What I also see is how 2018 drove us from our traditions and home. And I also see how my family tried to come together and begin to heal."

<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>

<p>In 2019, Allovue doubled in size. We acquired Equiday. We started to put a lot of work into scaling our people and processes and started to work on some still-secret projects that I believe will be the core of our next decade of success. Elsa and I took a wonderful trip to Spain. I failed to keep up with any meaningful physical health routine, but my mental health improved. 2019 is one of the best years I have had in a long time. I rose to meet some major challenges. I traveled more for fun than I have in years. I felt more secure in my friendships, and I felt more secure in my ability to do my job. It took a decade, but at the end of 2019, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about the adult I am still becoming.</p>

He was always generous to my ideas and experience managing software and technical integration projects in a dramatically different environment and helped me to understand how software was built differently in product companies and software consultancies. He always respected and elevated my technical skills, both within our private conversations and with colleagues. I still struggle with feelings of inadequacies in this area, but Ted never hesitated to lift me back up and remind me we all struggle with imposter syndrome. He never made me feel not up to the task, but instead like I had someone to work with to get better. I think it was his idea that I should be made Chief Product Officer, or at least I know that he was strongly consulted about my growing role at Allovue. And when he left Allovue in 2017, he was clear that he felt comfortable doing so in part because of his faith in my ability to take on the leadership of the team he worked hard to build.

			<h1><a href="https://json.blog/2019/12/30/223827.html">Using GLightbox with custom Hugo shortcodes on Micro.blog</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://json.blog/2019/12/30/223827.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-30 23:38:00 -0400">Dec 30, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am working on writing a &ldquo;decade in review&rdquo; blog post for here and decided it would be cool to include some image galleries. Inspired by <a href="https://shindakun.dev/posts/adding-an-image-lightbox-to-microblog/">Steve Layton&rsquo;s post</a>, I thought <a href="https://biati-digital.github.io/glightbox/">GLightbox</a> sounded like just the thing I was looking for.</p>

<p>But whereas Steve&rsquo;s clever trick was to use Javascript to add the right structure to all the images on his site, I decide to go a different route and write a custom Hugo shortcode to support using <code>GLightbox</code>. Custom shortcode? Shortcode? If you&rsquo;re not familiar with this part of Hugo, the static site generator that powers Micro.blog under the hood, well you&rsquo;re not alone. A shortcode is a Hugo-specific extension to your Markdown posts so that using a specific syntax you can dynamically create complex HTML content. For example, you can use a <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#youtube">Hugo shortcode for YouTube videos</a> so that you only have to supply a small ID slug and the proper embed HTML is generated.</p>

<p>Since getting <code>GLightbox</code> to look right with images requires a fair amount of HTML markup, I wrote the following in my custom Micro.blog design under <code>layouts/shortcodes/glightbox.html</code>:</p>

<script type="application/javascript" src="//gist.github.com/jsonbecker/d7e57ec8e928de5cac01834a3aaee9eb.js"></script>

<p>Check out my post on <a href="https://micro.json.blog/2019/06/22/three-vertigo-comics.html">Vertigo comics worth reading</a> to see GLightbox in action using this short code on my Micro.blog site!</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve shaved that yak, I can get back to writing my decade review and finding the pictures I want to use for it.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Since it’s funding formula time in RI again, here’s a list of things I’d change, in no particular order.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use AEWAV for state share of pension costs.</li>
<li>Increase state aid significantly that goes through the formula— say at least 25% over 5 years.</li>
<li>Lower base and add weights for home language (ELL proxy not determined by school staff) or “ever ELL” (ELL, but count a student who was ever and ELL and not just current).</li>
<li>Fully fund high cost SPED circuit breaker. Add a weight for high service percent per day SPED students, probably somewhere around 50% in service.</li>
<li>Double pay about 5% on charters (districts hold back 5% of total per pupil, state kicks that in extra for charters). Require districts offer underutilized space to charters with something like right of first refusal to try and reduce overall systems capital costs. Districts should risk forfeiting 5% if fail to offer space to charters.</li>
<li>Consider state wide minimum property/land tax to raise more money to go through the formula, reducing incentive/ability for high wealth districts to raise so much from local taxes the overall distribution of spending becomes highly regressive.</li>
